Explaining how it glues Kubernetes and OCI compliant runtimes and concluding it with a demo showing how Kubernetes uses CRI-O.

Link to video.\nFollowing a quick breather, was an informative talk by Budhram Gurung on Running OpenShift locally using Minishift, highlighting the inspiration for the project and covering components of Minishift with a demo showing it’s usage. Also, leaving behind a note on how one could reach out to the developers and contribute to Minishift.

another successful chapter of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/kubernetes-openshift-India-Meetup/events/238335903/">Bangalore Kubernetes Meetup</a>.
The Meetup had a good turnaround of about 40 people who gave up on their
early morning saturday sleep to attend it despite the sweltering hot
season and in line were four awesome talks.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/surajd_">Suraj Deshmukh</a> set the stage with his opening
talk, <em>Kubernetes on CRI-O</em>, wherein he explained different jargons like
OCI, CRI, etc., introduced CRI-O and it’s architecture. Explaining how it
glues Kubernetes and OCI compliant runtimes and concluding it with a demo
showing how Kubernetes uses CRI-O. Link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tP7b1e1fy-n3_v5bilDLjOAheZGu602B3WK-1kxXkVo/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>,

<p><img loading="lazy" src="/images/blr-k8s-meetup-april-2017/group.jpg" alt="Folks listening"  title="Folks listening"  />
</p>
<p>Next in queue, was another wonderful talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/dipakpawar231">Dipak Pawar</a>
about <em>System and integration testing for Kubernetes/OpenShift with
arquillian-cube and JBoss Forge</em>, elaborating the usefulness of
arquillian-cube’s integration for Kubernetes and OpenShift coupled
with Forge tooling for testing micro-services deployed on OpenShift/Kubernetes.

<p>Last, but not the least, planned talk was by <a href="https://twitter.com/red_suraj">Suraj Narwade</a>
on running <em>Docker on ARM/Raspberry PI</em>, wherein he enjoyed sharing his
experience of working on his hobby project, and all the problems faced by
him in trying to get containers running on Raspberry PI. He shared his

<code>x86_64</code>, to run on <code>arm</code>. Link to <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cJeQyMG_NOn8QDJpIHkAjTT4I0L6AyQ8DxeGbVWn850/edit?usp=sharing">slides</a>,

</p>
<p>Finally, an unanticipated lightening talk took the audience by storm where
a quick 3 minutes demo on <em>Persistent Storage with Kubernetes</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/raghavendra_t">Raghavendra Talur</a>
turned into a good discussion of 30 minutes. He demo-ed, hyper-converged
storage and dynamic provisioning with gluster and answered a lot of queries
regarding setting up storage with Kubernetes, finishing on a
to be continued note in the successive meetup.</p>
<p>The meetup concluded with discussion over snacks and planning for the next
chapter of this meetup, which will be a <strong>Kubernetes and OpenShift 101 workshop</strong>
for beginners.</p>
