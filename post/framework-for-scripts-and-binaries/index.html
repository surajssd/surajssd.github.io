  "articleBody": "I always had a conundrum about how to manage the scripts and binaries downloaded randomly from the internet. One way is to put them in the global PATH directory like /usr/local/bin, but I am sceptical about it.\nThere are a couple of things I wanted to solve. How do you update these scripts and binaries? How to do it consistently across all my machines? How to make it easier to have my setup available on any new Linux machine(or even container) I setup? How to do it without sudo?\nManaging random scripts Global scripts I have a Github repository where I have all my scripts and configurations. In the past, I use to copy these scripts into another directory which is in PATH viz. ~/.local/bin. This directory is added to PATH in Fedora by default.\nNow the problem with this copying approach was that if I had to make any corrections to the script because I found a bug. I had to make those changes in two places, one in the Github repository directory and other in the ~/.local/bin directory. As a human would, I use to forget making changes to the Github repository and this use to go out of sync pretty quickly.\nThat is when I thought of creating symlinks. Now all the files stay in the Github repository directory and then this installer script makes a symlink which is stored in ~/.local/bin. Now when I make changes to the script, those changes are in fact, happening in the repository. And whenever I have time I git commit those changes and git push them to Github.\nFor making changes to the scripts I just have to do this:\nvi $(which start-minikube) Local scripts There are scripts that you want to have only locally. Like syncing code to a remote server. These are the scripts you don’t want to share with the whole world. For this problem, I have added .scripts directory to the PATH variable in ~/.bashrc. Now anywhere I can create .scripts directory, it is automatically in PATH.\n$ cat ~/.bashrc | grep scripts export PATH=$PATH:.scripts Now with this foundational setup in place, whenever I have a project-specific script, I create a .scripts directory at the root of the project and put that bespoke script in that directory. So it is available for me from the root of the project directory.\nSince I am creating such directories which are unrelated to the project and should not be committed. I have a global entry for ignoring .scripts directory.\n# ignore the local scripts directory .scripts You can find my ~/.bashrc file here.\nProject Specific Scripts There are specific scripts that you want to use only for a project. Now you might wonder why not contribute them to the project itself. There could be scripts to copy code to a remote server; you don’t want to contribute such scripts to the project because they are particular to your workflow. In such a case, I have something called a project-specific .scripts directory in the root of the project. Read more about it in detail in this another blog post of mine here.\nManaging random binaries Now many projects ship their binaries off of their Github releases but don’t have a package made for an operating system. Now packaging an application for every operating system could be a daunting task for the maintainers of the project, not everyone is willing to take that on their plate(I am grateful those maintainers already working on the open source project I don’t expect them to do more work).\nTo manage binaries of such projects, you need your own mechanism of downloading the new versions and replacing older ones. For this again, I rely on my ~/.local/bin directory. Here I put such downloaded binaries. And for the tools that I need regularly, I have created scripts for them. These scripts are managed as explained in the Global scripts section.\nFor example, I use helm regularly, and I need it to be updated as new releases come. So I have a script with following code snippet:\ncurl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-\"${version}\"-linux-amd64.tar.gz tar -xvzf helm-\"${version}\"-linux-amd64.tar.gz mv linux-amd64/helm ~/.local/bin/ Now in the above code snippet, I require the user to provide the version. But some tools have consistent naming off of the Github releases so for them I don’t require the user to provide the version and finding version is automated as well. For example, the easiest way to find the latest version is using the Github API:\nfunction get_latest_release() { version=$(curl --silent \"https://api.github.com/repos/$1/releases/latest\" | grep '\"tag_name\":' | sed -E 's/.*\"([^\"]+)\".*/\\1/') } And use above function like this in my scripts:\nget_latest_release bash/minikube So if you compare the UX for both of them this is how it looks like. One that requires version:\n$ update-helm v3.2.4 + cd /tmp + curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 12.3M 100 12.3M 0 0 3054k 0 0:00:04 0:00:04 --:--:-- 3055k + tar -xvzf helm-v3.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz linux-amd64/ linux-amd64/helm linux-amd64/README.md linux-amd64/LICENSE + mv linux-amd64/helm /home/suraj/.local/bin/ One that does not require version:\n$ update-minikube Downloading minikube v1.12.1 Downloaded successfully in ~/.local/bin/ Setting up a new machine With all that framework in place, whenever I setup a new machine all I need to do is run following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/surajssd/dotfiles cd dotfiles make install-all That’s it!\nWith this simplicity I get all the goodness of the scripts and since this repository also places my custom ~/.bashrc I get all the aliases I use to be productive on shell.\nConclusion You can also setup a similar workflow for your scripts and binaries. This will provide you immense boost in productivity. Also if you have some better way to do same sripts and binaries management please share with me here or on Twitter. Happy Hacking!\n",

There could be scripts to copy code to a remote server; you don&rsquo;t want to contribute such scripts to the project because they are particular to your workflow. In such a case, I have something called a project-specific <code>.scripts</code> directory in the root of the project. Read more about it in detail in this another blog post of mine <a href="https://suraj.io/post/project-specific-scripts/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="managing-random-binaries">Managing random binaries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#managing-random-binaries">#</a></h2>
<p>Now many projects ship their binaries off of their Github releases but don&rsquo;t have a package made for an operating system. Now packaging an application for every operating system could be a daunting task for the maintainers of the project, not everyone is willing to take that on their plate(I am grateful those maintainers already working on the open source project I don&rsquo;t expect them to do more work).</p>
<p>To manage binaries of such projects, you need your own mechanism of downloading the new versions and replacing older ones. For this again, I rely on my <code>~/.local/bin</code> directory. Here I put such downloaded binaries. And for the tools that I need regularly, I have created scripts for them. These scripts are managed as explained in the <a href="/post/framework-for-scripts-and-binaries/#global-scripts"><strong>Global scripts</strong></a> section.</p>
<p>For example, I use <code>helm</code> regularly, and I need it to be updated as new releases come. So I have <a href="https://github.com/surajssd/dotfiles/blob/master/local-bin/update-helm">a script with following code snippet</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-<span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">version</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">tar -xvzf helm-<span class="s2">&#34;</span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nv">version</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&#34;</span>-linux-amd64.tar.gz
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">mv linux-amd64/helm ~/.local/bin/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now in the above code snippet, I require the user to provide the version. But some tools have consistent naming off of the Github releases so for them I don&rsquo;t require the user to provide the version and finding version is automated as well. For example, the easiest way to find the latest version is using the Github API:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="k">function</span> get_latest_release<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">  <span class="nv">version</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>curl --silent <span class="s2">&#34;https://api.github.com/repos/</span><span class="nv">$1</span><span class="s2">/releases/latest&#34;</span> <span class="p">|</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    grep <span class="s1">&#39;&#34;tag_name&#34;:&#39;</span> <span class="p">|</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    sed -E <span class="s1">&#39;s/.*&#34;([^&#34;]+)&#34;.*/\1/&#39;</span><span class="k">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="o">}</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>And use above <code>function</code> like this in <a href="https://github.com/surajssd/dotfiles/blob/master/local-bin/update-minikube#L9">my scripts</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">get_latest_release bash/minikube
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>So if you compare the UX for both of them this is how it looks like. One that requires version:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ update-helm v3.2.4
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">+ <span class="nb">cd</span> /tmp
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">+ curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">+ tar -xvzf helm-v3.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">linux-amd64/
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">linux-amd64/helm
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">linux-amd64/README.md
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">linux-amd64/LICENSE
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">+ mv linux-amd64/helm /home/suraj/.local/bin/
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>One that does not require version:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">$ update-minikube
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Downloading minikube v1.12.1
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Downloaded successfully in ~/.local/bin/
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="setting-up-a-new-machine">Setting up a new machine<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#setting-up-a-new-machine">#</a></h2>
<p>With all that framework in place, whenever I setup a new machine all I need to do is run following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git clone https://github.com/surajssd/dotfiles
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> dotfiles
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">make install-all
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>That&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>With this simplicity I get all the goodness of the scripts and since this repository also places my custom <code>~/.bashrc</code> I get all the aliases I use to be productive on shell.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>You can also setup a similar workflow for your scripts and binaries. This will provide you immense boost in productivity. Also if you have some better way to do same sripts and binaries management please share with me here or on Twitter. Happy Hacking!</p>
