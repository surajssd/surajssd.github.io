    "description": "How Hindus need to introspect and evolve!",
    "body": "There are numerous Hindu festivals celebrated throughout the year. The rituals associated with each festival differ to the extent these festivals are celebrated. I am here to recount the environmental impact of the customs Hindus are involved in.\nAlthough a ritual associated with each festival and its effect on the environment is insignificant on a small scale. But with Hindus in India being close to a billion (966 million as per the 2011 census, with the population growth rate that might be almost a billion), these rituals don\u0026rsquo;t scale very well. The practices Hindus have been following, believing them benign, just a form of worshipping their god of belief. Let us look at the environmental impact of various rituals performed on particular occasions (festivals, funeral).\nDiwali Diwali is one of the major festival celebrated across the country with pomp and is a major Hindu festival. Diwali is a festival of lights celebrated in Lord Ram\u0026rsquo;s memory returning to Ayodhya after defeating Ravan. For the three-four day span of this festival, the central part of the celebration, apart from lighting the diyas, is setting off firecrackers. These firecrackers, some of them intense in sound, others vivid in colours, cause a lot of smoke and sound, thus causing Air and Noise pollution. If colourful and less noisy, the firecracker produces a lot of smoke, while the ones that make less smoke produces a lot of noise.\nThe lighting of firecrackers was okay when fewer Hindus had a means of procuring it or when Hindus themselves were lesser in number. But with close to a billion people setting these explosives off, it is sure to contribute to four-day noise pollution and contributing to air pollution. Air pollution is already rampant and getting worse every year. Given the rapidly reducing tree cover (in India precisely and in the world in general), burning firecrackers is not helping it curb in any way. Among the top nine most polluted cities, as of this writing, in the world, eight are in India.\n This custom may have begun on the Indian subcontinent after 1400 CE when gunpowder started being utilised in Indian warfare.\n So the lighting of firecrackers started only in the fifteenth century, and I am pretty sure that there was no Gunpowder at the time of Lord Ram. Gunpowder was only invented in the ninth century CE. Also, no scriptures encourage or mention the usage of gunpowder-laced explosives to celebrate the festival. Hindu fanatics who vehemently support burning firecrackers and destroying our only home (this earth) defy the Hindu belief of treating this earth as one\u0026rsquo;s mother. They are ready to exploit her, ignorant of their hypocrisy. When rational people point this out, some conservatives start indulging in whataboutery, pointing at the firecracker bursting at a new year celebration. I would like to say that regardless of the reason to burn these firecrackers, I would still oppose it. But this blog is specific to the Hindu community not able to reform itself in the face of changing circumstances.\nI think the middle ground can be established by educating folks about the harm the current firecrackers are causing to the environment. If there is an innovation in creating these firecrackers like a firecracker that generates vivid colours but does not create the awful side effects like sound and air pollution. But the government has to intervene on environmental grounds by levying heavy taxes on the sale of firecrackers, so average Indian associates burning a firecracker as burning cash. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think any political party would come forward (at least aggressively) to find a permanent solution to this problem without taking a toll on their vote bank. Hence supreme court had to intervene at the inability of the governments to act. Subsequently, the Delhi state government acted only last year to ban firecrackers. Despite this ban, there was no enforcement; if there was any, the air quality index would have reflected that. I think Science and Technology is the only solution to this problem.\nLet us not politicise this issue and look at the long term. Since this practice was established by us, so can this be abolished by us. Let nobody fool you into thinking that this act of renunciation is in any way an attack on Hindu religion or western influence. What good a ritual (illegal to the scriptures) would be if it makes life unbearable for us today and for posterity?\n",

    "description": "Get a fine grained view of the happenings on your system!",
    "body": "How do you monitor your own computer? Of course, using Prometheus, node-exporter and Grafana. You might ask why would you wanna do that when you can simply use the operating system provided, \u0026ldquo;System Monitor\u0026rdquo;. Well, yes, you can use that. But the data you get from the OS System Monitor is coarse-grained. OS system monitor is not configurable, but this stack is.\nIt is like running htop but where you can go back in history, unlike htop, which only shows the current state. Using this stack of Prometheus, node-exporter, and Grafana is a proactive approach than being reactive to the problems that occur on a PC. Instead of digging later to figure out what went wrong, you are already collecting metrics so you can see on dashboards what went wrong.\nNOTE: This blog is helpful to you only if you are using a Linux desktop that you would want to monitor. Here docker is used to run tools like node-exporter, and docker does not work natively neither on OSX or Windows. Docker on OSX and Windows runs in a VM, and there is no use in monitoring a VM; the objective of this blog is to monitor your PC.\nPrerequisites  Install Docker. Install docker-compose.  Installation Download the configuration manifests git clone https://github.com/surajssd/node-monitor cd node-monitor Install the configuration There are two ways to install this stack one as a user systemd, and the other is to dump configs to a directory and manually run docker-compose commands. I would recommend using the user systemd path because it is a cleaner approach. You can interact with the service using systemctl, and journalctl and the services restart automatically once the PC is started.\nExecute the following command to install it:\nmake install-user-systemd Now go to this URL localhost:3000 to access the Grafana already installed with the Node Exporter dashboard. The login user name and password by default is admin. You can choose to change it at login.\nDebug  To view the logs of the running containers, run the following command:  journalctl --user -u node-monitor  If containers fail to start, run the following command to delete the stale containers:  docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)  I hope you find this helpful and learn exciting stuff just watching the dashboard about your system.\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "The first step in your CKA preparation!",
    "body": "If you are studying for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam, you might have come across folks recommending Kelsey Hightower\u0026rsquo;s Kubernetes the Hard Way. It is an excellent first step for someone who has no idea about the components that form a Kubernetes cluster. As the name suggests, it is created so that you learn the Kubernetes building blocks the \u0026ldquo;hard way\u0026rdquo;.\nBut all that can be intimidating to someone who hasn\u0026rsquo;t played with Kubernetes ever. Also, the guide uses Google Cloud as a platform to install everything, which mandates you to have a Google Cloud account. But don\u0026rsquo;t worry, there is a version of Kubernetes the Hard Way, which runs locally, hence free. Enter Kubernetes the Hard Way Vagrant!\nKubernetes the Hard Way Vagrant, was started by folks at Kinvolk. It is a set of scripts that does the exact same thing done in Kelsey\u0026rsquo;s KTHW. The only difference is that it is automated with scripts and, at the same time, gives you the flexibility to do things manually if you like. These scripts help any newbie understand how a Kubernetes cluster can be brought up one node at a time. They can study each and every step of cluster creation and replicate those steps manually. Another minor difference is that this repository uses cri-o as a container runtime instead of containerd used in Kelsey\u0026rsquo;s tutorial.\nTo get started, all you need is a machine with 4.8 GB of spare memory and enough CPU to run seven small VMs. Install Vagrant and VirtualBox to run these VMs. Once you have these prerequisites, all you need to do to get started is run the following steps:\ngit clone https://github.com/surajssd/kubernetes-the-hard-way-vagrant cd kubernetes-the-hard-way-vagrant ./scripts/install-tools ./scripts/setup That\u0026rsquo;s all. And the ./scripts/setup will start three controller machines and three worker machines, and a load balancer machine, install the Kubernetes components and run them. See the following image to understand what the architecture looks like:\nYou can run individual script invoked by ./scripts/setup manually to get an in-depth understanding of what is happening underneath. Find more explanation on each sub-script on the README.\nThis repository is an excellent first step to doing Kelsey\u0026rsquo;s KTHW on Vagrant. I hope you find this helpful.\n",

    "title": "How we manage Kubernetes Bangalore Meetup?",
    "date": "",
    "description": "The method of stress-free event management!",
    "body": "I took the reins of the Kubernetes Bangalore Meetup back in 2017. I have been organising the meetup since then. Earlier with Suraj Narwade, Aditya Konarde and now with Prakash Mishra. Over time the meetup has grown a lot, now it boasts about 5000 members. Organising meetup earlier was a straightforward affair, especially with Narwade and Konarde being my colleagues and friends. We could chat about the upcoming meetup at any time we would like, and it was all spontaneous. Once they left in 2019, Prakash took over as co-organiser, and we are managing the meetup since then.\nAlthough Prakash and I never worked in the same company, we managed meetup over the phone, text and did tasks as we recalled them. Also, we met every month during the meetup, we brainstormed various ideas on what could be the potential topic or what our audience is looking for. With pandemic, that changed. Now only text or phone was not helping a lot.\nLast year I had a personal transformation with the book \u0026ldquo;Getting Things Done by David Allen\u0026rdquo; and Notion for my personal task management. I decided to give it a try with the help of Prakash to create a Notion page for our meetup management. It was a simple checklist of tasks to do on every meetup. We identified the tasks we do for every meetup that are recurring and added them to a template. So with every meetup, we create a new page from the existing template and fill in values.\nThis template has gone transformation multiple times, as is the nature of the changing world. Like earlier, when we were doing online meetups using StreamYard streaming directly to YouTube. If you wonder why StreamYard, well, Zoom was paid, Google Hangouts disabled the steam to YouTube feature and using Google Meet wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option because we needed the recording for folks to watch later on our YouTube channel. StreamYard was the only free option that allowed the stream to YouTube. But using StreamYard became monologue-ish because we only allowed speakers on StreamYard. The interaction between speakers and attendees was only via YouTube chat. That\u0026rsquo;s when we moved from StreamYard to Zoom (a sponsored account). After doing this switch, we changed the template.\nWe start out with the \u0026ldquo;New Meetup\u0026rdquo; button, which is just a template of tasks that we do on every meetup:\nOnce the page is created, then we start following the checklist. Some tasks are inherently assigned to one of the organisers. Like I am permanently assigned the task of creating the Zoom meeting invite. This is because Kinvolk (my employer) is sponsoring the Zoom for the meetup, and I have access to the Zoom account.\nA typical page for the meetup looks like the following. This page is from the planned March meetup:\nSome tasks will only be done before, during and after the meetup.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s about it. There is no rocket science behind this. You can use our Notion template to manage your meetup or create your own. To design your own, it will need some efforts and reflection. After moving the meetup management to the Notion checklist, the benefits we found were immense, like we did not miss anything in the plan. We were not panicking about finding specific information like we did before, and most importantly, it was all stress-free.\n",

    "title": "On Compounder Skills",
    "date": "",
    "description": "The foundational skills which improves everything else.",
    "body": "There are specific skills which you should acquire early on in your life. These skills are the foundational skills. Everything you do after developing these skills becomes better, faster and easier. I call these skills Compounder Skills. Derived from the term \u0026ldquo;Compound Interest\u0026rdquo;. The idea is that once you are laced with a particular compounder skill, you can apply it in various fields of your life. An example of a compounder skill that most humans get exposed to is \u0026ldquo;school education\u0026rdquo;. The disadvantages of being unlettered are numerous viz. being dependent for information, gullible to most straightforward scams, the limited scope of jobs they can do, etc.\nThis blog tries to enlist some of the compounder skills I think everyone should have. This is certainly not an exhaustive list of all the skills a human should have. There is a limited time we have on this earth, and the possibilities of learning are endless. Sometimes it is better to get help from a professional, you can\u0026rsquo;t do everything by yourself. Also, this list is very much composed from my experience in life, and you might think that there are specific other skills that qualify as compounder skills, which is fine as well.\n🤔 Infinite Curiosity We are super curious as infants, but it starts to recede as we grow old and get accustomed to things and start assuming things the way they are without considering why it is that way. Nurturing a genuine curiosity towards anything and everything, in general, is a great first thing to have. This curiosity is what will drive you to learn more and get into action. This will be your driving force for everything you do. I won\u0026rsquo;t classify \u0026ldquo;curiosity\u0026rdquo; as a skill but a learnable trait.\n The curious are also provided with much fun and wisdom long after formal education has ended. — Charlie Munger\n 📖 Reading The first and foremost skill everyone needs to enhance is reading. After we complete our formal education, we might feel like it is the end of the learning for life. Someone with a fixed mindset like that generally sees a very slow upward trajectory in their job and life. Doing the same things repeatedly will not result in progress. What got you here might not be helpful to go upwards. There are so many things worth learning that are not taught in school education. Later in professional programs, the scope becomes even narrower. Every individual needs to study psychology, philosophy, history, business skills, finance, investment, etc.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t read something because someone recommended a book. Read things that interest you, so it does not feel like a chore but more of a fun thing to do. If you face some problem at work or in life in general, then read a book that promises to provide a solution to your problem.\nThe reading does not have to be restricted to books only, but blogs can also work. But the benefits that a book provides are immense, it is not condensed like a blog, and you understand concepts with contexts that blogs might not have. The bottom line is knowledge is power. Knowledge comes from reading. Power helps you propel upwards.\nRead what you love until you love to read.\n\u0026mdash; Naval (@naval) May 31, 2018  ✍ Writing Once you get accustomed to reading, don\u0026rsquo;t just swallow it mindlessly. If it is fiction, it is okay. But if you are reading non-fiction, business, philosophy, or psychology, then take notes in your own words. Write down your digested thoughts. Highlights won\u0026rsquo;t cut it. Highlights are just out of context text for your future self. Please note down the feeling you had or the insight that came to you, and that made you highlight that text. Your notes will help your future self add meaning to the highlights and bring the feeling and insights back to life.\nOnce you form the habit of writing, especially writing it in public, you will start formulating your opinions and ideas. Since you will be writing about something to explain it to others, you will have a more precise understanding of the topic yourself. You will start forming mental models, and you will understand what fits where. You will create connections of non-relating topics, and out of these connections, you will come up with unique ideas that are original and your own.\nDo writing in public or not, it will help you clarify concepts. If you do it in public, you are making your thoughts open to others, thereby increasing your chances of serendipitous encounters. We, as knowledge-workers, have relied mainly on writing to convey our thoughts. With pandemic, as more and more people start working remotely, the importance of writing to share your ideas has never been so immense. Since you will present your thoughts very clearly and concisely, you will have an advantage over someone who cannot convey their thoughts in writing. You will be more productive.\n⌨ Typing \u0026ldquo;Typing\u0026rdquo;, yes, is a vital skill if you are a knowledge-worker. Like I mentioned before, the importance of writing has increased significantly since the pandemic for everyone and especially for anyone working remotely. But how do you write, of course not using your hand but using the keyboard! Hence along with writing, the typing also has to be faster and improved. If you are slow in typing, your keyboard will only come in your way of thinking. The tool will make you laboured; hence you might lose the train of thought. If you are wondering how to improve typing skills, read it here.\n✅ Task Management Task management is something everyone should be well versed in. I think doing the right thing at the right time is very important. And for that, you need a system that guides you through your day to day, week to week, month to month and year to year. Without such a deliberate approach, you will just go with the flow or react to whatever life throws at you. Having a system of managing tasks makes you \u0026ldquo;proactive\u0026rdquo;. As per the second law of thermodynamics, things left on their own devices generally become messy and chaotic. You need to put extra work to keep them in equilibrium.\nA task management system does not matter how you implement it; it will make more room in your 24hrs for you to do work for which you could never find the time otherwise. Since the system will become your life operating system, everything will be kept track of. Hence you will have visibility of your long term goals, short term projects and immediate tasks. You will have a compass of your life and the things you wanna achieve.\nOnce you have such a system in place, you will be confident of finishing and seeing through any significant endeavour you undertake. It won\u0026rsquo;t guarantee 100% success, but it does ensure a 100% input. It will give you a clear picture of what went wrong or what things you did not track but should have followed.\nSince this system acts as a guard rail on what you are doing, it helps you focus and not get distracted by every new shiny thing that comes along and distracts you from your work.\nFocus requires saying no to great opportunities.\n\u0026mdash; Kelsey Hightower (@kelseyhightower) August 9, 2019  Reading the book \u0026ldquo;Getting things done by David Allen\u0026rdquo; is a great first thing to do in this direction.\n🧠 Knowledge Management With the amount of knowledge you will be processing after reading and writing notes from that reading, you need a place to capture all that knowledge and wisdom. Generally, folks keep it in notebooks, but then once those notebooks are filled, they are shoved in some corner of the cupboard and never opened again. Such information is hard to find, and physical notebooks don\u0026rsquo;t feature \u0026ldquo;quick access\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;search\u0026rdquo;. You might keep such knowledge in google docs, but again even that can get scattered really quickly.\nCreate a system with accessibility in mind. Store the knowledge and wisdom in such a way that whenever your future self wants to read or find it, they can do it with as less hurdles as possible. Recollect an instance when you were thinking about this term or an excellent insight when reading something. You even wrote it down somewhere. Now you don\u0026rsquo;t know where and how to find it and what word to search for? So do your future self a favour by doing extra work now.\nThis will make sure you have a single place for your knowledge once you have that and you keep visiting this place time and again you keep that knowledge current, and there is a high chance that you form connections among the various pieces of knowledge.\nI have had quite a ride with my knowledge management experiences which are documented here. Now I follow the principles mentioned in the book \u0026ldquo;How to take smart notes by Sönke Ahrens\u0026rdquo; for taking notes.\n💰 Investment skills I think the whole talk of compounder skills is incomplete without talking about the compound effect on the money itself. Gain knowledge of investment early on in your life. The small investments you make early on, armed with compound interest, pay big time later in your life. Even if you start earning a lot later in your life, the compounded funds' value early on will give substantial results to you than what you will make. Learning how to invest even a small per cent of your earnings every month than squandering everything will help you in the time of crisis. You don\u0026rsquo;t need to do day trading, but knowing the tools and the jargons will definitely help you.\n The aforementioned list followed an order. Each skill created groundwork for the next one and so on. It is essential to have the skill to perfect the subsequent ones. Having one helps exponentially on the next ones.\nNow that you are well versed in reading, capturing what you are reading, presenting your thoughts, managing your tasks and investing money so that it is not rotting stagnant in one place. I think you have a solid foundation to build the Burj Khalifas of the world. The work does not end here. The task of identifying the compounder skills is continuous. Keep an eye; it is never too late to start learning them. But as the nature of compounding goes, it pays off if you hone these skills early on in your life. Compounder skills fall into the \u0026ldquo;Important but not urgent\u0026rdquo; quadrant of the Eisenhower matrix. I implore you to start working on them and improve your life as a result.\n",

    "title": "Importance of Typing Skills",
    "date": "",
    "description": "The foundational skill which improves everything else.",
    "body": "Yes, today\u0026rsquo;s topic is typing skills. I think not many people stress about it, but it is a very underrated skill, yet useful in our daily lives.\nI typed the most organic way anybody starts doing it. Look at the keyboard when you are typing and fix mistakes after looking at the monitor. I moved my hand around on the keyboard and only used index fingers to touch the keys as if other fingers were glued together away from the keyboard. I learned the QWERTY keyboard\u0026rsquo;s keys placement while playing GTA Vice City with a friend since I typed cheat codes. Although I was still looking at the keyboard and typing, I did not search for the keys.\nFast forward from the school days of GTA Vice City to programming days during undergrad (engineering). Now I was more comfortable with my laptop keyboard and managed to type without looking at the keyboard. However, I was still moving my hand around and only using the index finger for alphabets and occasionally using thumb or pinky finger for special keys. Since I was only comfortable with my laptop\u0026rsquo;s keyboard, being fast enough to type on any other keyboard would feel cumbersome because either the keys were a different size or differently placed.\nIn 2015 I came across this term called touch-typing. It is the first thing that is taught in the DgpLUG. DgpLUG is an IRC based summer training conducted by Kushal Das and a bunch of other people. They teach basic things like touch-typing, git, Linux, communication, etc. I gave a desultory look at touch-typing and figured that I could not be bothered with learning that. Why spend extra effort to learn something as basic as \u0026ldquo;typing\u0026rdquo; anew when you get the job done?\nNow fast forward to my first job at Red Hat. I am a professional software engineer, and I still hadn\u0026rsquo;t gotten my typing any better. I was still using the index fingers, was only productive on one keyboard at a time, etc. While in one of the team meetings, I volunteered to take meeting notes, and it turns out I was terrible at it. That\u0026rsquo;s when I remembered touch-typing and decided to give it a go. I immediately googled for online resources and found out typingclub.com as a top result. I started following the tutorials, doing exercises every day for thirty minutes before beginning the office work (almost managed to annoy a co-worker with the keyboard noise). It was a grievous period since I was unlearning something as vital as typing the old way, and all the muscle memory was built around old habits and learning a new method of doing it. It can be correlated to unlearning walking forward and now learning to walk only sideways or backwards. But I relented and started doing touch-typing slowly. Over time as the new muscle memory was built, I surpassed the old typing speed. The kind of boost I felt after touch-typing is the same as when a limping person discovers running. Over the last three to four years, I have acquired good enough speed to take notes from the meetings.\nI think touch-typing is an essential skill that is not taught when kids take up computers. And then it is a painstaking job to unlearn old behaviours and learn new ones. But something to understand here is that as a knowledge worker, the computer keyboard is the only (unless you don\u0026rsquo;t mind pen and paper) way we will churn out information. Although speech to text converters are catching up, they do a cursory job and generally get in your way, thus breaking your train of thoughts. A keyboard is a tool, and if you are not productive at the devices you use, they will only get in your way of thinking and executing the actual thing. Typing is not the \u0026ldquo;actual task\u0026rdquo; but simply a means to an end. The content (code, essay, blog, tweet) you create by typing is the measure of how good you are. Nobody will see how fast or slow you have typed. Everyone else is concerned with the result only. But then, if you are typing, it should be second nature should happen involuntarily without you having to think about typing but only about the thing you are typing.\nFinally, improve this fundamental foundational skill of typing, and everything else you do with it will be better.\n",

    "description": "The story of various tools I have used over last five years.",
    "body": "Photo by Patrick Tomasso on Unsplash.\n If you are reading this, you are definitely a Knowledge Worker. As Knowledge Workers, we rely a lot on the information we know or have access to for our day to day work. Occasionally, we will do the same thing twice, face the situation more than once, want to read that reference or try to understand the insights mentioned in that one particular blog. How do you keep track of such information? How do you find such information again after you have researched it once?! You need a knowledge management system that aids you in revisiting such information.\nThis blog is about my \u0026ldquo;Knowledge Management\u0026rdquo; journey. The various approaches I have applied over the years, how one became cumbersome over others, and the benefit of subsequent methods over the previous one. If you wanna skip the boring history and get to the solution, then you can just jump to that last two sections. But I think you would appreciate the importance of the last approach only if you know why it is better than others.\nGoogling is not the Best Strategy! If you find yourself googling, again and again, it is a clear sign you want that information quicker in terms of accessibility. Now it depends on the nature of the data. It could command you want to run again, or it could be some term in a specific blog you want to look up for your writing, etc.\nTweeting it out In my early days on Twitter, I was only a leecher. Once I struggled with the information storage problem, Twitter turned out to be the best platform to change my leecher hat for a seeder. I decided to tweet any new information I learnt with a tweet. The tweet format used to be something like Problem Statement: \u0026lt;solution link\u0026gt;.\nhttperf starter: https://t.co/Lo6Qv2hE6p\n$ 𝚑𝚝𝚝𝚙𝚎𝚛𝚏 --𝚑𝚘𝚐 --𝚜𝚎𝚛𝚟𝚎𝚛 \u0026lt;𝚎𝚗𝚍𝚙𝚘𝚒𝚗𝚝\u0026gt; --𝚞𝚛𝚒 \u0026quot;/\u0026quot; --𝚗𝚞𝚖-𝚌𝚘𝚗𝚗 𝟷𝟸𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟶𝟶 --𝚗𝚞𝚖-𝚌𝚊𝚕𝚕 𝟸 --𝚝𝚒𝚖𝚎𝚘𝚞𝚝 𝟻 --𝚛𝚊𝚝𝚎 𝟺𝟶𝟶𝟶 --𝚙𝚘𝚛𝚝 𝟾𝟶\n\u0026mdash; Suraj Deshmukh | सुरज देशमुख (@surajd_) November 27, 2020  Or if it is a command-line thing, then the structure would be Problem Statement: \u0026lt;solution commands in monospace\u0026gt; Source link: \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;.\nAn easier way to find if a service is active?\n```\n$ systemctl is-active gdm\nactive\n$ systemctl is-active docker\ninactive\n$ systemctl is-active foobar\ninactive\n```\nHelpful in scripting!\nCaution: But one problem is that it does not error when a service does not exists!\n\u0026mdash; Suraj Deshmukh | सुरज देशमुख (@surajd_) August 7, 2019  If I needed anything from my past tweets, I could simply go to my \u0026ldquo;Profile\u0026rdquo; and search for the problem statement. Once the tweets grew on my \u0026ldquo;Profile\u0026rdquo;, searching went out of hand. Also, the search feature of Twitter is cumbersome to use.\nThe Problem of searching tweets To overcome the search-on-your-Profile problem, I wondered what if I can use Twitter API to download all the tweets from my account and store them in a plain text format to grep it later? To materialise that idea, I wrote this script (tweetbase) that would download all the tweets and dump them into a file. The only downside was that I had to run it periodically so that the local file is up to date with the Twitter profile. This has served its purpose to date.\n$ ./run \u0026gt; plain-text-tweets.txt 2021/02/22 10:45:01 All clients ready 2021/02/22 10:45:02 Credentials verified 2021/02/22 10:45:03 Got max id: 1363704708418871301 2021/02/22 10:45:03 Tweets download started 2021/02/22 10:45:13 Tweets download complete 2021/02/22 10:45:13 Tweets dumped to ./alltweets.json $ grep -i hostpath -A 1 plain-text-tweets.txt 5683:Correction: Whitelisting `allowedHostPath` doesn\u0026#39;t help.

Also, Twitter API trims the tweet content, so even if you had typed detailed information, it might not be searchable in the plain text file. You can see that the text is redacted with an ellipsis (...).\nWrite a script to automate There are specific commands that you need again-and-again. I would automate that by putting them into a single script.\nFor, e.g. certain websites disable pasting text into text boxes, and I found a solution to enable pasting. When I discovered it first, I tweeted about it.\nFor the websites that disable paste, override it on #chrome using the following #javascript code. Copy and paste it in the chrome console.\nSource: https://t.co/NGUNIz26di\nFor #firefox read the steps 👆 pic.twitter.com/oDdMGG7EHT\n\u0026mdash; Suraj Deshmukh | सुरज देशमुख (@surajd_) December 17, 2020  I found myself visiting such websites multiple times. Thus, to copy the solution, I would see the Twitter profile page (until the page was searchable using Ctrl + F). Once the tweet on the profile got buried, I started digging (grepping) into the plain-text-tweets file and then jumping to the tweet.\n$ grep -i paste -A 1 plain-text-tweets.txt 470:Copy paste 👇 471- -- 773:var allowPaste = function(e){ 774- e.stopImmediatePropagation(); -- 777:document.addEventListener(\u0026#39;paste\u0026#39;, allowPaste, true); 778-URL: https://twitter.com/surajd_/status/1339602792143458304 When this happened more than a couple of times, I decided to script this thing and make this affair faster. The script can be found here. Now I just run the script, and the contents are copied to the clipboard to be executed into the chrome tab.\n$ make-chrome-copy-pastable.sh The code has been copied into the clip board. Now goto chrome and press Ctrl + Shift + I and paste into the console window. I have explained in this blog my scripts framework. I have used similar approaches to update the tools I need at their cutting edge. This way, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to search for how to update them every time. I just run the script.\nYour own blog should be easy to find I started writing blogs where tweets did not serve the purpose. My blogs' nature was problem-oriented (the problems that I encountered and the solution that worked for me in my environment). With blogs, I took an NIH approach (even if there were blogs already written about that topic, I thought I might write it in my words). It served two purposes; they made it easier to search for information for which I had a readymade solution, and the process of writing made my understanding clear. When you write something to explain to others, you must understand all the nitty-gritty details to explain the topic to others in easy to understand language. Since the blogs were created for public consumption, I ensured that I did not make assumptions or tried to make it generic and think from various perspectives.\nWith that being said, there\u0026rsquo;s still a limit on how much one person can process and distil into writing. My reading volume was many folds greater than the content I was writing. To store information reliably, I needed something that can capture the entire web page and have a search facility, so if I just entered a term, it would fetch all the pages with that term. I gave serious thought to creating a scraper using Python\u0026rsquo;s Scrapy framework but then never got time to do it by myself.\nSave to read later For the blogs or articles I read, I would save them into Pocket and still do. It is a great tool to keep anything with a web link instead of using just bookmarks. Pocket downloads the webpages by rendering them into a screen-adjustable format. Pocket solved what I was looking for, something that would download the web page\u0026rsquo;s contents to search later. Pocket\u0026rsquo;s search functionality was not so good, and sometimes it rendered pages poorly or only halfway through.\nPocket became my dumping ground for anything, and everything I would wanna read later. It was an endless list stack of blogs, articles, videos and podcasts. The common problem of all the hoarding methodologies (caused by collector\u0026rsquo;s fallacy) that I was employing (Twitter, tweetbase and Pocket) was that I was only hoarding information. Never gave a thought to how do I want my future self to find that information. Apart from writing blogs, the other methods didn\u0026rsquo;t make it easier to find information.\nMoving on from hoarding to ease-of-finding Enter the Notion. The solution to every problem is not a Notion page, as shown in this image, but a Notion database, yes.\nThe Notion database feature is very flexible. Each row is a page, unlike spreadsheets. The page\u0026rsquo;s recursive nature makes Notion databases powerful, within page or database within a page, plus the ability to refer one column of one database into another database.\nMy Notion system is built similar to what August Bradley has recommended (Media and Notes). I have two Notion databases; one stores \u0026ldquo;Media\u0026rdquo; (blogs, videos, podcasts, books), and the other one is called \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo;, and both of these databases are linked.\nThe Media database has columns that allow me to store metadata like the type of content, category of content, how likely you think it will be relevant, etc. These columns can later be used to filter and create dashboards. Like if I want to view just the media of type articles and in the technology field, I can make a dashboard named \u0026ldquo;Read - Technology\u0026rdquo; and have a filtered view of a database. To import content into the Media database, I use the Notion web clipper. It captures all the content in that webpage and saves it as a Notion page in a database. Once that webpage is copied in Notion, now you can decide what you want to highlight or bold or italic, etc.\nWhile reading, if I have insights, I write those insights and original thoughts into the Notes database. Since these insights were drawn while reading an article, I refer to the Media database field in the Notes database to link them.\nThis approach is doing upfront work so that you help your future self. Pocket does not provide so much flexibility as Notion does, and there is no way to store your thoughts in Pocket, Pocket limits on how much you can achieve with the stored content, etc.\nFinally I am using Notion to store something I want to find later. There I can take notes and link the notes to the media source it came from. The Notion has a quick general search function that searches through all the pages. Your brain is the ultimate search engine. Writing notes in your own words helps you form a mental model by connecting various neural pathways. But for anything else, Notion web clipper with Notion databases is a saviour.\n",

    "title": "Book: How Innovation Works",
    "date": "",
    "description": "And Why It Flourishes in Freedom by Matt Ridley",
    "body": "Introduction I recently finished reading the book: \u0026ldquo;How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom\u0026rdquo; by Matt Ridley. The book was published less than a year ago in May 2020, and it is a short read of fewer than four hundred pages. I am not sure how to categorise this book, it probably falls into business, science and/or technological history.\nWhile listening to Naval Ravikant\u0026rsquo;s podcast, I found this book when Matt Ridley, the author, was a guest in one episode. I was profoundly influenced by the introduction of the book I got in the podcast.\nI would suggest just read the introduction (The Infinite Improbability Drive) for a starter. You will be inspired to read the book. The book is an easy read for anyone and everyone. Specifically, if you want to be a part of innovation, identify innovation, convert ideas to reality, and become an innovator, this book is for you.\nAbout the book The author has promised the readers in the \u0026ldquo;Introduction\u0026rdquo; particular insights and conveyed them in the book\u0026rsquo;s subsequent chapters. The author\u0026rsquo;s primary purpose is to tell the stories of innovation across various periods of human history, learn from them, and build a perspective about innovation happening right now in your surroundings.\nThe author starts out with innovation stories across various human aspects like energy, health, transportation, food, everyday home technologies, computing and communication, and pre-historic humans' innovation. In the later chapters the author goes into the insightful introspection of innovation viz. graduality of innovation, where it thrives, the role of serendipity in innovation, innovation due to remixing of ideas, the importance of trial and error, innovation as a group activity, inevitability of innovation when the conditions are right. Furthermore, the nature of innovation, and how it is mostly a precursor to science than the implementation of science, the myth of job losses due to innovation. Finally, the author discusses how specific agents try to hinder the innovation viz. governments, law, incumbent organisations, investors, NGOs trying to stand for the public, etc.\n Innovations come in many forms, but one thing they all have in common, and which they share with biological innovations created by evolution, is that they are enhanced forms of improbability.\n Effect on me I could relate to the book remembering how inventors' stories were told to me when I was a child. The invention was generally attributed to an individual without telling the whole story of how the situation back then was perfect for innovation or how that person had got this idea from somewhere else, and how he managed to get the patent and had his name engraved in history. Such deep-rooted misbeliefs of lone inventors with eureka moments were uprooted by this book.\n innovation is nearly always a gradual, not a sudden thing. Eureka moments are rare, possibly non-existent, and where they are celebrated it is with the help of big dollops of hindsight and long stretches of preparation, not to mention multiple wrong turns along the way. Archimedes almost certainly did not leap out of his bath, shouting ‘Heureka’; he probably invented the story afterwards to entertain people.\n My most favourite part of the book is the book\u0026rsquo;s stories. And of course, the insights become much easier to understand because they are drawn from the stories. These stories could be a good conversation starter, in any social setting.\nThe book has made me an innovation optimist. I had become pessimist by the news that hyped up about the failed innovations or news of the innovation\u0026rsquo;s harmful outcomes. And my views were mostly sceptical of anything new that came out.\nWhen you are working on something, it is easy to get bored with everyday stuff, and you may feel the insignificance of day-to-day work. But this book kind of imbibed in me the patience that up-close things will look slower. It is only when you zoom out over timeline of months or years you can see the progress you have made, the innovation that has happened and you were a part of that innovation journey.\nOpen Source a beacon of hope for innovation The book propounds the importance of open sharing of ideas and information as a way to the progress of humankind. He has shown how the patent and IP system built to protect the individual inventor has come to stifle the human progress, and open sharing of knowledge is the way to go forward. I could especially relate to the book because I worked on open-source software and worked at Red Hat in the past. Both things are mentioned in the book. The amount of innovation that goes on in the openly shared information is tremendous and hard to match anywhere else.\nSuppose a single entity wholly contributes to creating something new without much help from outside. In that case, I think they are entitled to have a patent and reap the benefits that come out of that creation. But most of them who just assemble stuff from others and patent that gathered stuff without much investment should share their information freely. The sheer first-mover advantage will primarily benefit them if the innovation is correctly applied to harness scale economies.\n Inventing something gives you a first-mover advantage, which is usually quite enough to get you a substantial reward. Cunning inventors can throw their imitators off the trail with misleading details: Bosch was careful to let Haber reveal only the second-best catalyst recipe for fixing nitrogen.\n Innovation makes things accessible There is far too much importance given to the person who came up with the idea. Still, a lot of work goes behind bringing that idea into a product and to the masses. The real difference is created by the person who brings the cost of the innovation down so that the ordinary person can afford it. For example, Elon Musk is trying to get the cost of space travel down his team is doing a lot of innovation at SpaceX. He has identified that if humans want to colonise Mars, then the cost per take-off should be brought down substantially. This cost reduction goal is partially achieved if compared to the pre-SpaceX days.\nThe following quotes from the book corroborate what I am trying to say here:\n Again and again in the history of innovation, it is the people who find ways to drive down the costs and simplify the product who make the biggest difference. The unexpected success of mobile telephony in the 1990s, which few saw coming, was caused not by any particular breakthrough in physics or technology, but by its sudden fall in price.\n in the early years of computers, mobile phones and many other innovations, the inventors thought they were developing a luxury good for the upper-middle classes. It took a farmer’s son from Detroit to turn the car from a luxury invention into an everyman innovation: an affordable utility for ordinary people.\n Inevitability of Innovation The book teaches you to be an opportunist. If there is an obvious opportunity to do innovation, grab that opportunity and do it. If it is not you, then someone else will certainly do it. This certainty is possible because the conditions for such innovation are created.\nYou may have experienced this that you get an idea one day and think to yourself that, \u0026ldquo;Wow, that is such a novel idea!\u0026rdquo;. Still, later it turns out that someone somewhere has already thought about it. In some form, that idea is ready to be materialised, or it\u0026rsquo;s put out there textually. In such a situation, even if somebody is bringing the concept to life, there is no harm in giving it a try to materialise the vision yourself. With your skills and edge, maybe you might do a better job of doing justice to the idea!\n The lesson of wheeled baggage is that you often cannot innovate before the world is ready. And that when the world is ready, the idea will be already out there, waiting to be employed: in America, at least.\n In hindsight, you might feel that you could have done a better job had you bet on your idea and try to convert that into reality.\n Yet here is a paradox. There is an inevitability about both search engines and social media. If Larry Page had never met Sergei Brin, if Mark Zuckerberg had not got into Harvard, then we would still have search engines and social media. Both already existed when they started Google and Facebook. Yet before search engines or social media existed, I don’t think anybody forecast that they would exist, let alone grow so vast, certainly not in any detail. Something can be inevitable in retrospect, and entirely mysterious in prospect. This asymmetry of innovation is surprising.\n Parallels with thermodynamics The author has repeatedly tried to find a correlation between the entropy in thermodynamics and innovation. Innovation is a business of putting the atoms in a highly improbable structure which is highly efficient and leads to positive outcomes.\n Innovation, like evolution, is a process of constantly discovering ways of rearranging the world into forms that are unlikely to arise by chance – and that happen to be useful. The resulting entities are the opposite of entropy: they are more ordered, less random, than their ingredients were before. And innovation is potentially infinite because even if it runs out of new things to do, it can always find ways to do the same things more quickly or for less energy.\n In the final chapter, the author concludes as follows:\n The peculiar fact that one species above all others has somehow got into the habit of rearranging the atoms and electrons of the world in such a way as to create new and thermodynamically improbable structures and ideas that are of practical use to the wellbeing of that species never ceases to amaze me. The future is thrilling and it is the improbability drive of innovation that will take us there.\n Concluding thoughts Apart from one part where I don\u0026rsquo;t share the author\u0026rsquo;s scepticism of the project hyperloop, rest of the book is an excellent collection of stories and insights.\nAs I said, the book had a profound perspective shift for me. And I think the book would do the same to you. I would highly encourage you to read the book and share how you could relate with the book and which parts of the book you highly appreciate.\n The main ingredient in the secret sauce that leads to innovation is freedom. Freedom to exchange, experiment, imagine, invest and fail; freedom from expropriation or restriction by chiefs, priests and thieves; freedom on the part of consumers to reward the innovations they like and reject the ones they do not.\n References and Links  Book Link on Goodreads.

    "title": "Enable TLS bootstrapping in a Kubernetes cluster",
    "date": "",
    "description": "Add a new node using a bootstrap token to Kubernetes",
    "body": "This blog is a recap of my old blog \u0026ldquo;Add new node to Kubernetes cluster with bootstrap token\u0026rdquo;. Like the aforementioned blog, we will look at how to enable TLS bootstrapping on an existing Kubernetes cluster at control plane level and add a new node (or modify existing ones) to the cluster using bootstrap tokens. At the end of this blog, you will learn what specific steps to take to enable TLS bootstrapping on any custom-built Kubernetes cluster.\nTextual 1. Kubernetes Cluster If you have a cluster running, you can skip this step. To demonstrate how TLS bootstrap tokens work, I have brought up a cluster using Kubernetes the Hard Way (Vagrant). This section shows how to bring up a multi-node, multi-worker Kubernetes cluster quickly.\n1.1. Setup Machine I am running this setup on a Ubuntu 20.04 machine. Install virtual-box and vagrant by executing the following commands as the root user:\napt-get update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get -y upgrade \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y make git byobu linux-generic systemctl reboot apt-get install -y linux-headers-`uname -r` \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt install -y virtualbox \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ apt-get install -y vagrant \u0026amp;\u0026amp; \\ dpkg-reconfigure virtualbox-dkms 1.2. Clone the Repository mkdir -p git/kubernetes-the-hard-way-vagrant git clone https://github.com/kinvolk/kubernetes-the-hard-way-vagrant git/kubernetes-the-hard-way-vagrant cd git/kubernetes-the-hard-way-vagrant 1.3. Install the Cluster ./scripts/install-tools ./scripts/setup 1.4. Verify the Cluster Installation kubectl get nodes 2. Prepare Control Plane 2.1. Setup RBAC When a new node tries to authenticate to the control plane, the only credential used is a bootstrap token. Such a node client (kubelet) is a member of group system:bootstrappers, we need to ensure that such a client has permissions to create Certificate Signing Requests (CSRs), get them approved, renew them, etc. The following ClusterRoleBindings will ensure that these nodes join without authorisation issues. This setting needs to be done only once and does not change from node-to-node.\nRun the following command to create the bindings that will allow the new nodes to connect to the cluster:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | kubectl apply -f - # Enable bootstrapping nodes to create CSR. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: create-bootstrapping-csr subjects: - kind: Group name: system:bootstrappers apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: system:node-bootstrapper apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io --- # Approve all CSRs for the group \u0026#34;system:bootstrappers\u0026#34;. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: approve-csrs subjects: - kind: Group name: system:bootstrappers apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: system:certificates.k8s.io:certificatesigningrequests:nodeclient apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io --- # Approve renewal CSRs for the group \u0026#34;system:nodes\u0026#34;. apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 kind: ClusterRoleBinding metadata: name: approve-node-renewals subjects: - kind: Group name: system:nodes apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io roleRef: kind: ClusterRole name: system:certificates.k8s.io:certificatesigningrequests:selfnodeclient apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io EOF 2.2. Modify Kubernetes Apiserver Add the following set of flags to the kube-apiserver:\n--authorization-mode=Node,RBAC --enable-bootstrap-token-auth=true Above setting needs to be performed on each control plane node.\n2.3. Modify Kubernetes Controller Manager Add the following flag to the kube-controller-manager:\n--controllers=*,tokencleaner,bootstrapsigner Above setting needs to be performed on each control plane node.\n3. Modify / Add Workers 3.1. Create the Bootstrap Token Please note these tokens, we will need them in two places. One, while creating a bootstrap-token embedded Kubernetes Secret object and another in the bootstrap kubeconfig for the Kubelet:\nTOKEN_ID=$(openssl rand -hex 3) TOKEN_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 8) 3.2. Create Bootstrap Token Secret Kubernetes apiserver will use this secret to identify the node that is joining the cluster. Execute the following command to create the secret embedding the previously generated tokens:\ncat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | kubectl apply -f - apiVersion: v1 kind: Secret type: bootstrap.kubernetes.io/token metadata: name: bootstrap-token-$TOKEN_ID namespace: kube-system stringData: description: \u0026#34;Manually generated bootstrap token.\u0026#34; token-id: \u0026#34;$TOKEN_ID\u0026#34; token-secret: \u0026#34;$TOKEN_SECRET\u0026#34; usage-bootstrap-authentication: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; usage-bootstrap-signing: \u0026#34;true\u0026#34; EOF 3.3. Create Bootstrap Kubeconfig for Kubelets Create bootstrap Kubeconfig for Kubelet(s):\nSERVER=$(kubectl config view -ojsonpath=\u0026#39;{.clusters[0].cluster.server}\u0026#39;) CA_CERT=$(kubectl config view --flatten -ojsonpath=\u0026#39;{.clusters[0].cluster.certificate-authority-data}\u0026#39;) cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;EOF | tee kubeconfig apiVersion: v1 kind: Config clusters: - name: local cluster: server: \u0026#34;$SERVER\u0026#34; certificate-authority-data: \u0026#34;$CA_CERT\u0026#34; users: - name: kubelet user: token: \u0026#34;$TOKEN_ID.$TOKEN_SECRET\u0026#34; contexts: - context: cluster: local user: kubelet EOF Keep this file around it will be needed to connect worker(s) node using bootstrap token to control plane.\n3.4. Modify Kubelet Copy the bootstrap kubeconfig created in step 3.3 to the worker node you want to connect to control plane using bootstrap tokens. Save the kubeconfig on the node and provide the path to that file to flag --bootstrap-kubeconfig. The path supplied to --kubeconfig will have newly downloaded kubeconfig once the kubelet authenticates with the kube-apiserver.\nAdd the following set of flags to the kubelet:\n--kubeconfig=/var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig --bootstrap-kubeconfig=/etc/kubernetes/kubeconfig --rotate-certificates NOTE: You can remove the file in /var/lib/kubelet/kubeconfig, especially if you modify an existing worker node, to ensure that Kubelet downloads the new kubeconfig at that location.\nYou can have a separate token for each worker node to reduce the attack surface. To generate distinct token repeat steps 3.1 to 3.4 for each worker node. But if you wish to use the same token for each worker node, repeat step 3.4 on each worker.\n4. Verify Ensure that the node has joined the control plane using TLS bootstrap token by executing the following command:\nkubectl get nodes Video Watch this video to understand the same process explained in this blog. Unlike my previous blog videos, I am narrating, so you know what is going on.\n  References  Authenticating with Bootstrap Tokens.  ",

Setup Controller Node Run these steps only on the controller node.\n2.1.

    "description": "The correct way to use exec and the signal passing.",
    "body": "If you use exec in your container script, then the container or Kubernetes pod might exit after the command that is exec-ed into has exited. But if that\u0026rsquo;s what you wanted, then it\u0026rsquo;s okay. This blog tries to explain how to pass the signals to the applications, how they work differently when invoked uniquely and what to do if the application does handle them.\nWhat are the \u0026ldquo;Signals\u0026rdquo;? Signals are messages one process can send to another process, mostly used in UNIX like operating systems.\nHow exec works in Linux? This is copied from the man page:\nAn application spawned by a shell script. To ensure that the signals are passed effectively to the real application, spawned by a shell script, you can do something similar to what is done in this snippet. Use trap to call a function which does the cleanup after receiving any of the registered signals like SIGHUP, SIGTERM or SIGINT.\n#!/bin/bash  function cleanup() { kill \u0026#34;${pid}\u0026#34; exit } trap cleanup SIGHUP SIGTERM SIGINT echo \u0026#34;sleeping\u0026#34; sleep infinity \u0026amp; pid=\u0026#34;${!}\u0026#34; wait \u0026#34;${!}\u0026#34; If a process runs in foreground spawned by a bash script, then the bash script does not respond to the signals, so the trap is rendered useless. Hence run it in the background and wait on it using wait. Make sure that the script is run via ENTRYPOINT the way it is done in this Dockerfile:\nFROMquay.io/surajd/fedora-networkingCOPY ./cleanup.sh /cleanup.shENTRYPOINT /cleanup.shSince the above script, cleanup.sh is listening on three types of signals: SIGHUP, SIGTERM, SIGINT if any of these is sent to the script the container will stop working. So the following commands will work just fine:\nHere is a video that shows how the above commands works:\n  An application spawned directly. Here is a golang application that handles signals. This golang app can be run directly via ENTRYPOINT.\nFROMquay.io/surajd/fedora-networkingCOPY ./signals /signalsENTRYPOINT /signalsThis golang code is also listening on the same signals: SIGHUP, SIGTERM, SIGINT. The code has a main goroutine which spawns another goroutine. The background goroutine is listening to the aforementioned signals. While the main goroutine is waiting (←done) for the background goroutine to receive signal and finally exit. In the Dockerfile, we have simply copied the binary directly and spawn it using ENTRYPOINT, this ensures that the application receives the signals directly. ENTRYPOINT is actually starting the given process using exec.\nWatch the video below, which shows how the signals are passed to the application:\n  When should you use exec? Now consider that you have an application which listens to those signals, but for some reason, you need to spawn that application via a shell script. This is when you use exec. We are using the same golang application as before but spawning it from a bash script. Notice that this script is invoking that golang binary using exec, this replaces the bash script with golang binary as PID 1.\n#!/bin/bash  echo \u0026#34;spawning the golang app\u0026#34; # This app can handle the signals so no need to handle them on # behalf of the application here in the bash script. exec ./signals FROMquay.io/surajd/fedora-networkingCOPY ./signals /signalsCOPY ./startup.sh /startup.shENTRYPOINT /startup.shIf we get shell access of the container, you will see that the golang signals app has become PID 1.\nHere is the video that shows these signals passing in action:\n  Conclusion I hope this gives you some clearer picture on how to use exec sanely and make sure that the applications are spawned correctly to get the signals sent by their environment be it systemd, docker or Kubernetes.\nReferences  Signal IPC.

    "title": "Mental models for understanding Kubernetes Pod Security Policy",

    "description": "Getting the game of PSP right!",
    "body": "PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) is hard to get right in the first attempt. There has never been a situation when I haven\u0026rsquo;t banged my head to get it working on the cluster. It is a frustrating experience, but it is one of the essential security features of Kubernetes. Some applications have started shipping the PSP configs with their helm charts, but if a helm chart does not ship a PSP config, it must be handcrafted by the cluster-admin to make the application work reliably in the cluster.\nThis post assumes that you already know what Pod Security Policies and Role-based access control (RBAC) are. You can find the best explanation of the basics from the upstream documentation.\nThis post will define a nomenclature for PSP types, how a cluster-admin can create a PSP that is allowed for all workloads, and how a developer can generate PSP from scratch. This post won\u0026rsquo;t try to define steps on achieving above but will give guidelines and point you into the right direction for securing your cluster with PSPs.\nPolicy Order Some PSPs also mutate the pod specification besides allowing or disallowing pods. The policy order of Kubernetes documentation states the following two ways a PSP is chosen for a pod:\n If a PSP allows the pod specification as is without a mutation, then that PSP is used. If the above condition fails, then the fist PSP is chosen from an allowed-PSP list, and the pod is mutated accordingly.  So from the above policy order, we can infer that we will need two sets of PSPs in a cluster:\n Application-Specific PSP: This ensures that the pod passes as it is without a mutation. The application developers have to ensure that the PSP config they ship with the deployment manifests should match exactly otherwise their application could either be disallowed from working in a PSP enabled cluster or runs at reduced privileges (due to mutation) enforced by cluster-wide PSP. Cluster-wide PSP: The cluster should have a \u0026ldquo;restrictive\u0026rdquo; policy which comes into the picture as per the second point in the policy order. Such a restrictive PSP should be allowed to all the workloads.  Application-specific PSP These are the general steps I take when crafting the PSP that is application-specific:\n Lockdown the application with the help of pod\u0026rsquo;s security context. Explore each option in the security context and decide what is suitable for the application. Ensure that the application is working fine in the above-restricted settings previously unknown to the application. Start from privileged PSP (see below) and keep restricting it as per the application pod specification.  apiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: privileged annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; spec: privileged: true allowPrivilegeEscalation: true allowedCapabilities: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; volumes: - \u0026#39;*\u0026#39; hostNetwork: true hostPorts: - min: 0 max: 65535 hostIPC: true hostPID: true runAsUser: rule: \u0026#39;RunAsAny\u0026#39; seLinux: rule: \u0026#39;RunAsAny\u0026#39; supplementalGroups: rule: \u0026#39;RunAsAny\u0026#39; fsGroup: rule: \u0026#39;RunAsAny\u0026#39; source: Kubernetes PSP documentaton, privileged PSP.\nOnce the above conditions are satisfied, it does not matter what you name it, because this PSP will be given first priority over any other allowed PSP since it enables the pod created by your application to pass precisely without any mutation.\nIn the above gif, you can see that the wall has a hole (silhouette) of Bugs Bunny, think of it as if the Kubernetes cluster only allows PSP with bunny properties lets call it bunny-psp. Now the Elmer Fudd tries to enter through it but cannot since no PSP allows his properties to pass through. So the cluster-admin has to either create a PSP that matches his profile, and he can pass through the wall without hitting it.\nYou can also use tools like PSP advisor from sysdig, but please perform the above step 1 and step 2 from the above list before you use this tool. This tool basically automates the step 3 only.\nCluster-wide PSP These PSPs apply to the workloads that don\u0026rsquo;t ship their own PSP manifests. You would want your clusters to have a catch-all PSP config. Such a generalised PSP should ideally be restrictive in nature. The PSP should have everything locked down like no root user, no privilege escalation using privileged field, all the host namespace fields are disallowed, etc.\napiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: aa-restricted annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: \u0026#39;docker/default,runtime/default\u0026#39; apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: \u0026#39;runtime/default\u0026#39; seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: \u0026#39;runtime/default\u0026#39; apparmor.security.beta.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: \u0026#39;runtime/default\u0026#39; spec: privileged: false # Required to prevent escalations to root. allowPrivilegeEscalation: false # This is redundant with non-root + disallow privilege escalation, # but we can provide it for defense in depth. requiredDropCapabilities: - ALL # Allow core volume types. volumes: - \u0026#39;configMap\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;emptyDir\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;projected\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;secret\u0026#39; - \u0026#39;downwardAPI\u0026#39; # Assume that persistentVolumes set up by the cluster admin are safe to use. - \u0026#39;persistentVolumeClaim\u0026#39; hostNetwork: false hostIPC: false hostPID: false runAsUser: # Require the container to run without root privileges. rule: \u0026#39;MustRunAsNonRoot\u0026#39; seLinux: # This policy assumes the nodes are using AppArmor rather than SELinux. rule: \u0026#39;RunAsAny\u0026#39; supplementalGroups: rule: \u0026#39;MustRunAs\u0026#39; ranges: # Forbid adding the root group. - min: 1 max: 65535 fsGroup: rule: \u0026#39;MustRunAs\u0026#39; ranges: # Forbid adding the root group. - min: 1 max: 65535 readOnlyRootFilesystem: false source: Kubernetes PSP documentaton, restrictive PSP\nSuch a policy is allowed to every authenticated user (including service accounts) via the group system:authenticated.

You also need to make sure that this policy is on the top of the alphabetically sorted list. Ensure that the policy name starts with aa, so it is always on the top of the list.\nsource: What Cheese Looks Like Around The World by Insider.\nA generic restrictive PSP that mutates the pods looks like above, cheese cutting/moulding machine. It is ensuring that whatever comes out is of fixed mould, in case of Kubernetes the pod has fixed security restrictions.\nConclusion I hope this blog gives you some mental models of understanding how PSPs works in general. Although PSP is being discussed in upstream for replacing with something robust like the OPA Gatekeeper, it is not official yet. It is not clear when will that materialise, but until then, PSP is the saviour we have. If you are still confused about this, please reach out to me I will happy to explain.\nEDIT: The PSP is officially deprecated, I was wrong before to mention it is not deprecated yet. This was pointed out to me on a Reddit thread. According to this Kubernetes PR, PSP will be deprecated in Kubernetes v1.21 and removed entirely in v1.25.\n",

    "body": "Introduction How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking – for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers by Sönke Ahrens is a small (171 pages) non-fiction genre book. The book is a manual explaining Zettlekasten method designed by Niklas Luhmann. Sönke has used straightforward and simple English to explain the concepts. For anyone who is a knowledge curator or wishes to publish non-fictional content in any form (text, video or audio), this book is a must-read. I came across this book when I was watching a video by Ali Abdaal named \u0026ldquo;How I Remember Everything I Read\u0026rdquo;. Here he explains various levels of note-taking, how this book has influenced his note-taking capabilities and the foremost reason for making the video. I saw the book wasn\u0026rsquo;t that huge, I bought it and started reading immediately.\nWhat is Zettlekasten and who is Niklas Luhmann? Zettlekasten (German of slip box) was a technique created by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann. In physical terms, it is just a cupboard with multiple drawers holding slips. And in virtual expression, it contains knowledge storing framework similar to our brain. Luhmann used this framework of knowledge storage to think about ideas, and he created a plethora of books, articles and other published material. On average, he published at least two books every year until he was alive.\nWhat is the book really about? Suppose you are planning to research in some area. In that case, this book promises to give you techniques and tools. To build knowledge around that topic, keeping the references in an organised way, think critically on all aspects of that topic, form connections, draw pros and cons on your thinking and finally generate a manuscript based on the cluster of knowledge and ideas.\nNowadays, people are bogged down by the collector\u0026rsquo;s fallacy, and this book teaches you how to be a writer and not be an archivist.\n The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference.\n Usually, the approach of note-taking many folks follow is to highlight in the book and write a couple of lines in the margin of the book. Some copy the highlights verbatim, and people forget what that highlights meant when they come back to it later, if at all, to read those highlights. In this book, the author teaches you a new way to take notes. The book emphasises on not highlighting but paraphrasing the content or insights in your own words. Put those insights into a temporary system (fleeting notes) and process these fleeting notes daily and put them into your Zettlekasten in the form of permanent notes. Once you have multiple permanent notes (in the author\u0026rsquo;s words, \u0026ldquo;critical mass\u0026rdquo;), you can link them in the form of a graph.\n If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.\n The author tries to break the habit of traditional note-taking where the skeleton of notes is very similar to the content it was taken from, this format is linear. While the note-taking technique in the book is natural, identical to the way brain stores information in neurons. The data is stored with context links. The more contexts you have about specific information, the more you understand and remember it better hence the more ideas you can develop around such a topic. Ideally, your Zettlekasten should resemble your brain and thus help you form those context explicitly rather than you stumbling across such connections in the form of epiphanies. This way of note-taking makes developing insight a structured thing, unlike the usual messy approach.\n By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force.\n Internalising this technique takes discipline and unlearning old ways (which is the hardest thing). You have to be disciplined enough to take fleeting notes while reading the text and process those fleeting notes within a couple of days to form your permanent notes. Once you have a note which has multiple notes connected to it in the various context, you can create a manuscript out of it. So unlike the traditional method, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to start from blank paper to create content. You already have so much knowledge, facts, ideas and opinions built up, while reading and researching, that you just have to find a way to put it into a linear method on paper.\nStyle of the book The author has a humorous style of writing; thus, it makes an exciting read for a non-fiction genre book. I found myself giggling in between. In the start, I was a bit confused about the Zettlekasten system and found it really hard to wrap my head around this whole notion of clustered thinking. But as I kept going, I started grasping the book. Like, in the later chapters, the author does a walkthrough of converting an insight read from the text into a fleeting note and then into a permanent note. This helped me a lot with understanding how to think while reading, what questions to ask when taking fleeting notes and how to approach while generating permanent note out of a fleeting note.\nSince the author emphasises a lot on writing and its importance in thinking. So to corroborate his claims, he has given numerous examples of how it has been proven by various research that writing is critical to thinking and generating insights.\nPersonal Impact While reading the book, I had one question that should I start taking notes on anything and everything? That will seriously slow my knowledge consumption rate? I found this answer in a book club meeting. Where Sönke answered that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to take note about everything you read but only about the topics you are doing research and want to build \u0026ldquo;critical mass\u0026rdquo; around.\n Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read – until we try to rewrite it in our own words. By doing this, we not only get a better sense of our ability to understand, but also increase our ability to clearly and concisely express our understanding – which in return helps to grasp ideas more quickly. If we try to fool ourselves here and write down incomprehensible words, we will detect it in the next step when we try to turn our literature notes into permanent notes and try to connect them with others.\n So while reading anything new like a blog, I start out without a presumption of taking a note. Still, if I find something interesting, then I take a note in notes app or on a paper notebook. And I process it later and put it into my notes system. After reading this book, I haven\u0026rsquo;t become a fanatic notetaker. Because there are some concepts and ideas, I just want to be exposed to and not necessarily do a detailed study on it.\nI haven\u0026rsquo;t stopped highlighting in books. But taking notes in my own words has increased significantly. I am still trying to find a perfect tool for note-taking. But for now, I have started collecting notes in my Notion database. I think this will evolve as my experience with the system and content evolves.\nFor someone reading this book, having finished a couple of chapters, think about how you can take smart notes whenever you read something related to your research area. This exercise, although frustrating at first, will help you understand the rest of the book better. But again the book is worth coming back to, to calibrate your way of taking notes.\nMy personal take away in one line is \u0026ldquo;Writing is Thinking\u0026rdquo;.\nConclusion If you are looking for a way to do personal knowledge management, then this book is not for you. But if you want to research a topic and later publish stuff, then this is a good manual. Go ahead give it a try, it is not a giant book to complete cover to cover.\nPointers  Book\u0026rsquo;s Goodreads Link. My book highlights from Goodreads. Sönke\u0026rsquo;s website.

    "body": "Introduction The book \u0026ldquo;Algorithms to Live by — The Computer Science of Human Decisions\u0026rdquo; is written by \u0026ldquo;Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths\u0026rdquo;. It fits into the genre non-fiction, psychology and computer science. The book is written lucidly. If you have a background in computer science, then this book is easy to follow. The book creates analogies of computer science algorithms with real-life situations. I felt that some metaphors sound good in reading than their application, so if you plan on applying the things explained in the book directly to your life, they might not work. Because real-life has a lot of constraints that can be simplified in a computer algorithm to solve a problem, so the algorithms don\u0026rsquo;t apply vis-à-vis.\nAbout Book The authors are qualified to write this book because Brian holds degrees in Philosophy and Computer Science. At the same time, Tom is professor of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences at the University of California Berkeley. So they have a perfect mix of what was needed for the book.\nApart from drawing the parallels between algorithms and real-life, the authors have done an exceptional job in removing the stigma around the word \u0026ldquo;Algorithms\u0026rdquo; by making it more accessible to the layman who has never learnt a \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rdquo; of Computer Science. But my opinions here cannot be impersonal because I knew algorithms already and I was only revising. For a layman, I cannot exactly say if they can go and read algorithms after reading this book and be able to grasp all of it.\nThe authors have succeeded in persuading the reader that solving a real-life condition, the way algorithms do it, is the most efficient way to do. The book does accomplish its goal of conveying the insights from computer algorithms and trying to apply it in real-life. But the aspects of their usage in real-life is questionable as I mentioned earlier. The book is written in an easy to understand language.\nThe authors have chosen one part of computer science in each chapter. The chapter commences with an explanation of a real-life problem. Then it dwells into the solution computer science provides us in this case. Finally, what readers can do in the various real-life restricted situation and finally ends with enlightenments from the chapter on what to do in certain aspects. For, e.g. this is the quote from the last paragraph of the chapter \u0026ldquo;5. Scheduling: First Things First\u0026rdquo;:\n you should try to stay on a single task as long as possible without decreasing your responsiveness below the minimum acceptable limit. Decide how responsive you need to be—and then, if you want to get things done, be no more responsive than that.\n Unlike the above, not all suggestions will be instantly relevant.\nThe book is not academic as some might feel from the title. Still, the mathematical aspects of algorithms are incredibly minimal or close to none. The book has humour in between while reading I found myself chuckling on one line or another. For, e.g. read this:\n Tom\u0026rsquo;s otherwise extremely tolerant wife objects to a pile of clothes next to the bed, despite his insistence that it\u0026rsquo;s in fact a highly efficient caching scheme. Fortunately, our conversations with computer scientists revealed a solution to this problem too. Rik Belew of UC San Diego, who studies search engines from a cognitive perspective, recommended the use of a valet stand.\n Impressions on me I was already familiar with many CS algorithms. This book cemented my understanding by giving me something that I can easily visualise. My perception earlier was very computer-specific. I used to think only in terms of numbers and strings. Now it is more concrete, and I find myself identifying patterns where I can quickly apply a particular algorithm.\nMy favourite chapters from the book are \u0026ldquo;Scheduling: First Things First\u0026rdquo; and \u0026quot; Game Theory: The Mind of Others \u0026ldquo;. The former chapter helped me personally to devise a formula to prioritise the tasks that I do in my day to day life. Earlier I used to do it manually, but now I have added a formula in my Notion set up. With the later chapter, I had a lot of aha moments. It is because I had only heard about Game Theory but never knew what it was. This chapter gave real-life examples to explain what it is.\n Imagine two shopkeepers in a small town. Each of them can choose either to stay open seven days a week or to be open only six days a week, taking Sunday off to relax with their friends and family. If both of them take a day off, they\u0026rsquo;ll retain their existing market share and experience less stress. However, if one shopkeeper decides to open his shop seven days a week, he\u0026rsquo;ll draw extra customers—taking them away from his competitor and threatening his livelihood. The Nash equilibrium, again, is for everyone to work all the time.\n This book has removed one misconception that I had, that computers are very accurate with the results except in data science. I knew that in data science (machine learning) there is not a single answer, so there we can accept answers in probability. But it turns out there are so many situations in which computers rely on acceptable results and are not accurate. The reasoning behind these solutions not being exact is that it is costly to find a precise answer. We, as end-users, don\u0026rsquo;t realise it because the results are such and the probability of the solution being wrong is negligible.\n \u0026ldquo;The idea of the error tradeoff space—I think the issue is that people don\u0026rsquo;t associate that with computing. They think computers are supposed to give you the answer. So when you hear in your algorithms class, \u0026lsquo;It\u0026rsquo;s supposed to give you one answer; it might not be the right answer\u0026rsquo;—I like to think that when [students] hear that, it focuses them. I think people don\u0026rsquo;t realize in their own lives how much they do that and accept that.\u0026rdquo;\n One instance is in encryption:\n In practice, modern cryptographic systems, the ones that encrypt Internet connections and digital transactions, are tuned for a false positive rate of less than one in a million billion billion. In other words, that\u0026rsquo;s a decimal that begins with twenty-four zeros—less than one false prime for the number of grains of sand on Earth. This standard comes after a mere forty applications of the Miller-Rabin test. It\u0026rsquo;s true that you are never fully certain—but you can get awfully close, awfully quick.\n Closing Thoughts I would highly recommend this book to everyone. Anyone with a computer science background would highly enjoy the book because you can correlate with real-life circumstances. If you are studying computer science, then this is a highly recommended book because you will have another layer of understanding after reading this book. I have taken a ton of notes while reading this book, so I would not recommend the audio version of the book. There are charts and graphs in the book, not sure how they can be comprehended when listening to an audiobook. Look at the highlights from the book and maybe decide for yourself if this book is for you.\nReferences and Links  More information about the book on goodreads. My highlights from the book.

    "title": "How to gracefully kill Kubernetes Jobs with a sidecar?",
    "date": "",
    "description": "A sidecar in a Kubernetes Job, what? Yeah you might need one and here is how to shut it.",
    "body": "Have you ever had a sidecar in your Kubernetes Job? If no, then trust me that you are lucky. If yes, then you will have the frustration of your life. The thing is Kubernetes Jobs are meant to exit on completion. But if you have a long-running sidecar, then that might twist things for Kubernetes and in turn of you.\nWhy would you even want a sidecar for Job? Well, one of the most prevalent use case is when using service mesh proxy. There could be something else as well like metrics endpoint, log collection or whatever. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of the workloads, there could be any kind of use case that involves having sidecar for a Job pod.\nThis blog post will showcase how to cleanly exit from a Job pod if you have a long-running sidecar.\nNormal Job Let\u0026rsquo;s see how a normal Job workflow looks like. I have a Job that runs the following script:\n#!/bin/bash  for num in $(seq 10 -1 1); do echo $num sleep 1 done echo \u0026#34;And it is a lift off!\u0026#34; See the above script in the Github repository here.\nAnd the Kubernetes Job configuration looks like this:\napiVersion: batch/v1 kind: Job metadata: name: foojob namespace: default spec: template: spec: restartPolicy: OnFailure containers: - name: foojob image: fedora:32 command: [\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;] args: [\u0026#34;/scripts-dir/run.sh\u0026#34;] volumeMounts: - name: scripts-vol mountPath: /scripts-dir volumes: - name: scripts-vol configMap: name: scripts-configmap See the full definition of the Job configuration here. To understand why the Job configuration has volumes and volumeMounts, read my other blog where I explain how configmaps are the best way to use inject scripts into containers.\nA typical run of above will look like this:\n$ helm install --generate-name job/ NAME: job-1598685079 LAST DEPLOYED: Sat Aug 29 12:41:19 2020 NAMESPACE: default STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE foojob-86rlf 0/1 ContainerCreating 0 1s $ kubectl logs foojob-86rlf 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 And it is a lift off! $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE foojob-86rlf 0/1 Completed 0 14s So pod exits with STATUS field set to Completed.\nWhat happens when a Job has Sidecar? To add a sidecar to our existing Job I added a container which just sleeps forever. See following diff to understand what has changed:\ndiff --git job/templates/job.yaml job/templates/job.yaml index 04e7175..1bb5a08 100644 --- job/templates/job.yaml +++ job/templates/job.yaml @@ -9,6 +9,10 @@ spec:  spec: restartPolicy: OnFailure containers: + - name: endlesssidecar + image: fedora:32 + command: [\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;] + args: [\u0026#34;-c\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;sleep infinity; echo \u0026#39;stopping now!\u0026#39;\u0026#34;]  - name: foojob image: fedora:32 command: [\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;] See the new full configuration of Job manifest here.\n NOTE: In your case, it could be any other sidecar, for illustration purposes I have added a dummy sidecar.\n Now let\u0026rsquo;s see the full run of this setup:\n$ helm install --generate-name job/ NAME: job-1598685624 LAST DEPLOYED: Sat Aug 29 12:50:25 2020 NAMESPACE: default STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE foojob-kd9sl 0/2 ContainerCreating 0 1s $ kubectl logs foojob-kd9sl foojob 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 And it is a lift off! $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE foojob-kd9sl 1/2 NotReady 0 21s If you see everything went fine in the foojob container of the Job pod. But the pod STATUS has changed to NotReady. This is because one container has stopped successfully, and the other is still running. This is the problem with sidecar in the Job. Now Kubernetes does not concede this as Completed because not all containers have stopped in the pod.\nJob Sidecar with unique setup! Since the long running sidecar does not stop gracefully, we should make sure that it is halted. So the onus is on the foojob to kill the long running sidecar. So this is what I have added to our simple script:\ndiff --git job/scripts/run.sh job/scripts/run.sh index 8fed959..5932149 100755 --- job/scripts/run.sh +++ job/scripts/run.sh @@ -6,3 +6,6 @@ for num in $(seq 10 -1 1); do  done echo \u0026#34;And it is a lift off!\u0026#34; + +pkill sleep +true But have you realised how does a script running in one container has access to the process in another container? Well, we have a Kubernetes native answer to that: shareProcessNamespace. Here is what it mean straight from the docs:\n Share a single process namespace between all of the containers in a pod. When this is set containers will be able to view and signal processes from other containers in the same pod, and the first process in each container will not be assigned PID 1. HostPID and ShareProcessNamespace cannot both be set.\n In simple terms set the field shareProcessNamespace to true in pod.spec and all containers now share the process namespace and can see each other. Due to this enablement pkill sleep from the foojob container can kill its sidecar or sidecar\u0026rsquo;s main process.\nHere is the diff from the Job YAML file:\ndiff --git job/templates/job.yaml job/templates/job.yaml index 1bb5a08..61d75cf 100644 --- job/templates/job.yaml +++ job/templates/job.yaml @@ -7,14 +7,15 @@ metadata:  spec: template: spec: + shareProcessNamespace: true  restartPolicy: OnFailure containers: command: [\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;] - name: foojob - image: fedora:32 + image: surajd/fedora32-pgrep  command: [\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;] args: [\u0026#34;/scripts-dir/run.sh\u0026#34;] volumeMounts: The image has been changed from plain fedora:32 to surajd/fedora32-pgrep because the default fedora image does not ship pkill so I installed the package procps and now all the \u0026ldquo;process-killing\u0026rdquo; tools are available in the new docker image. See the dockerfile here.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s see this in operation:\n$ helm install --generate-name job/ NAME: job-1598689001 LAST DEPLOYED: Sat Aug 29 13:46:41 2020 NAMESPACE: default STATUS: deployed REVISION: 1 TEST SUITE: None $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE foojob-wr9hl 0/2 ContainerCreating 0 1s $ kubectl logs foojob-wr9hl foojob 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 And it is a lift off! $ kubectl logs foojob-wr9hl endlesssidecar Terminated stopping now! $ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE foojob-wr9hl 0/2 Completed 0 32s If you notice there is output from the sidecar as well, it first says Terminated which is as a result of the pkill we added. So that is the easiest way to kill the sidecar and satisfy Kubernetes.\nUpstream efforts  There is an issue in Kubernetes upstream for this, find it here. A KEP is present here. And this blog is very much inspired by this comment.  Conclusion We will just have to wait until we have the upstream with better support to segregate sidecar from primary containers in the pod. So until then, this hack is all we\u0026rsquo;ve got. You can find all the configuration used in this blog here.\n",

    "title": "Use Configmap for Scripts",
    "date": "",
    "description": "A new way to ship scripts to container images.",
    "body": "We generally use some sort of scripts in application container images. They serve various purposes. Some scripts might do an initial setup before the application starts, others may have the whole logic of the container image, etc. Whatever the goal may be the general pattern is to copy the script into the container image, build the image and then the script is available when you consume the image.\nCons of the Traditional Method The round trip time during development and testing of such script is very long. You make some change to the script, you need to build the image, push it and then it is downloaded again. On an average for every change adds a couple of minutes to your feedback loop. Bash scripts are generally precarious in nature. You have to hammer it down, consider edge cases and thereby make it robust. This, of course, takes a lot of iterations. And with iterations comes the added time. So the question is, how do we reduce this feedback loop?\nUse Kubernetes Configmap for Scripts Yes, put the scripts into Kubernetes Configmap. Let me explain. Instead of baking the script into the container image, put it into a configmap and then mount this configmap into the Kubernetes pod. Every time you make changes to the script, just update the configmap and kill the pod, so it picks up a new script from the configmap. The developmental round trip time now changes from a couple of minutes to a couple of seconds.\nDemo Here we will see how to convert a traditionally built container image with a script to configmap based script delivery mechanism.\nTraditional Method See the following directory structure. There is a helm chart in echoscript directory. Container image related configuration resides at the root of the project directory.\n. ├── Dockerfile ├── echoscript │ ├── Chart.yaml │ ├── templates │ │ └── deployment.yaml │ └── values.yaml └── run.sh 2 directories, 5 files The script does not do anything fancy, just prints some text and then sleeps, this is good for demo purposes. The docker file builds an image based on fedora:32 base.\n$ cat Dockerfile FROM fedora:32 COPY run.sh / ENTRYPOINT [ \u0026#34;/run.sh\u0026#34; ] $ cat run.sh #!/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;Hello from the script baked into the container\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Sleeping for eternity!\u0026#34; sleep infinity Let us build and push the image so that when we deploy the chart, the image is pulled successfully: docker build -t surajd/echoscript . \u0026amp;\u0026amp; docker push surajd/echoscript.\nThe deployment configuration is generic and there is nothing noteworthy in it.\n$ cat echoscript/templates/deployment.yaml apiVersion: apps/v1 kind: Deployment metadata: name: echoscript labels: app: echoscript spec: replicas: 1 selector: matchLabels: app: echoscript template: metadata: labels: app: echoscript spec: containers: - name: echoscript image: surajd/echoscript Deploy the chart using command helm install test echoscript/ and see it working:\n$ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE echoscript-f6499985c-tlr97 1/1 Running 0 57s $ kubectl logs -f echoscript-f6499985c-tlr97 Hello from the script baked into the container Sleeping for eternity! ^C Now every time you want to make changes to the run.sh script you will have to go through the build push cycle.\nConfigmap method Look at this new directory structure. There is no Dockerfile. It is because the script does not need anything other than built-in stuff from a container image if you need specific packages to be installed then build a container image. Also, see that the script run.sh is moved to scripts directory in the helm chart.\n. └── echoscript ├── Chart.yaml ├── scripts │ └── run.sh ├── templates │ ├── configmap.yaml │ └── deployment.yaml └── values.yaml 3 directories, 5 files There is a new configuration file called configmap.yaml. Look at the contents of that file:\n$ cat echoscript/templates/configmap.yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: ConfigMap metadata: name: scripts-configmap data: {{ (.Files.Glob \u0026#34;scripts/run.sh\u0026#34;).AsConfig | indent 2 }} So this will automatically load the run.sh from scripts directory into this configmap. I don\u0026rsquo;t have to keep the bash script in a YAML file indented. In this way, I have the independence of editing and viewing file in its original format.\nThere are certain changes made to the deployment manifest as well. Like mentioned earlier there is no specially built image so I can use my base image from the Dockerfile as the container image here. Then there is a config to invoke this bash script. And then parameters to bring the file from configmap into the container image by using volume mount.\n$ git diff echoscript/templates/deployment.yaml diff --git echoscript/templates/deployment.yaml echoscript/templates/deployment.yaml index 34fa7cb..3a10ca2 100644 --- echoscript/templates/deployment.yaml +++ echoscript/templates/deployment.yaml @@ -16,4 +16,13 @@ spec:  spec: containers: - name: echoscript - image: surajd/echoscript + image: fedora:32 + command: [\u0026#34;/bin/bash\u0026#34;] + args: [\u0026#34;/scripts-dir/run.sh\u0026#34;] + volumeMounts: + - name: scripts-vol + mountPath: /scripts-dir + volumes: + - name: scripts-vol + configMap: + name: scripts-configmap Let\u0026rsquo;s install it using command helm install configmapmethod echoscript/ again and see the result:\n$ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE echoscript-6479bf46cd-8t2dj 1/1 Running 0 25s $ kubectl logs -f echoscript-6479bf46cd-8t2dj Hello from the script residing in helm chart. Sleeping for eternity! ^C Now let\u0026rsquo;s make changes to the run.sh file. I have modified the file to look something like this:\n#!/bin/bash echo \u0026#34;Hello from the script residing in helm chart.\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;New line added here.\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;Sleeping for eternity!\u0026#34; sleep infinity Now apply these changes by running the command helm upgrade configmapmethod echoscript/. And kill the pod using command kubectl delete pod echoscript-6479bf46cd-8t2dj. Now let\u0026rsquo;s see if the new line shows up:\n$ kubectl get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE echoscript-6479bf46cd-mzgn7 1/1 Running 0 38s $ kubectl logs -f echoscript-6479bf46cd-mzgn7 Hello from the script residing in helm chart. New line added here. Sleeping for eternity! ^C So you can see from making the change to witnessing its effects it took less than a couple of seconds.\nCons of Configmap method  Platform: The most significant assumption this method adds is that you are using Kubernetes. Loose coupling: If the container image is used in multiple places, this requires that the user should create corresponding configmaps and volume mount configs. Ease of update: If you are not using helm or kustomize, then making changes to the configmap can be cumbersome, well, you can always do something like this:  kubectl create cm scripts-configmap --from-file echoscript/scripts/run.sh \\  --dry-run=client -o yaml | kubectl apply -f - Conclusion Both approaches have their own pros and cons. But to harness the benefits of both methods, create one config during development and use something else in deployment. That way, you will have the best of both worlds. You will have a faster round trip time in the development phase, and you don\u0026rsquo;t have to repeat the config in the deployment phase. Let me know what is your productivity hack with scripts when iterating on them in this container-dominant world.

It has become a de facto method of source code versioning, it has become ubiquitous with development and its an essential skill for a programmer. I use it all the time.\nBecause of its usage frequency, I wanted to optimise the number of keystrokes I made to get things done with it. I have made some tweaks and personalisation to my git workflow. Obviously, it involves aliases, scripts and other bash graphic tools.\nBash Aliases The most straightforward way to shorten any long Linux command is to use an alias. And I use quite a bunch of aliases for everyday git commands. I have aliases for things like checking out the master branch, pulling stuff from remotes commonly named upstream or origin, looking at git commits, rebasing and amending commits.\nConfiguration alias gpum=\u0026#34;git pull --ff upstream master\u0026#34; alias gpom=\u0026#34;git pull --ff origin master\u0026#34; alias gcm=\u0026#34;git checkout master\u0026#34; alias gs=\u0026#34;git status\u0026#34; alias gcmt=\u0026#34;git commit -s\u0026#34; alias gl=\u0026#34;git log --graph --pretty=format:\u0026#39;%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)\u0026lt;%an\u0026gt;%Creset\u0026#39; --abbrev-commit\u0026#34; alias grba=\u0026#34;git rebase -i --autosquash \u0026#34; alias gca=\u0026#34;git commit --amend --no-edit\u0026#34; Installation Above aliases you saw are placed in ~/.bashrc. You can find mine here.\nGlobal Git Configuration Configuration The contents of gitconfig file look like this. I don\u0026rsquo;t have a lot of customisation just basic stuff. In the following snippet code means Visual Studio Code. I use vscode as my primary editor so I prefer it to be my difftool as well. The entire gitconfig is stored in my dotfiles repository.\n[user] name = Suraj Deshmukh [color] diff = auto status = auto branch = auto interactive = auto ui = auto pager = true [diff] tool = default-difftool noprefix = true [difftool \u0026quot;default-difftool\u0026quot;] cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE [core] excludesfile = ~/.gitignore editor = code --wait Installation My global git configuration ~/.gitconfig is not something I create manually. I have an unusual way of creating it. So if you look at the configuration, it is just a symlink to the actual file which resides in my dotfiles repository. I have a special way of creating these symlinks, which is explained in my previous blog here.\n$ ls -al ~/.gitconfig lrwxrwxrwx@ 43 surajd 27 Jul 1:05 /home/surajd/.gitconfig -\u0026gt; /home/surajd/git/dotfiles/configs/gitconfig Repository Specific Git Settings There are some settings I want only for that particular repository. For instance, for my work, I sign-off all my commits with my work email id. For those repository-specific settings, I have a script which does the job for me.\nConfiguration Right now this is all I do for work repository, so that\u0026rsquo;s all I need.\ngit config user.email \u0026#34;me@work.com\u0026#34; Installation You can copy above snippet in a file make it executable and place it in your PATH. I have this file in a dotfiles repository from where a script creates a symlink for this executable file and places in the PATH. All this script management framework is explained in my previous blog post here. You can find the exact file here.\nBash Git Prompt Now when you are using plain old bash, it is not very helpful in terms of the context of the directory you are in. When you don\u0026rsquo;t have a visual aid, it is easy to make mistakes like commit something on the wrong branch or other undesired things. So I use this helper utility called bash-git-prompt which provides me with the git directory context. Like it tells me the path to the repository, the branch, the number of files changed, if the files are committed or untracked, exit code of the previous command, current time, etc. The bash prompt will change to look something like this when you are in a git repository:\n✘-127 ~/git/blog_contents [foobar L|✚ 1…1] 23:01 $ Configuration You need to have these two settings in your ~/.bashrc. So that the bash git prompt scripts are sourced every time the terminal starts.\n# Bash Git Prompt source ~/.bash-git-prompt/gitprompt.sh GIT_PROMPT_ONLY_IN_REPO=1 Installation Again this is installed easily using this helper script I have here. So I just have to run the command update-git-prompt, and then the repository is installed to be consumed.\nGit Push I have a script to push my changes to the PR I am working on. So every time I am done committing, I just need to do gpo.sh, and the changes are pushed to your origin remote. Behind the scene, there is a simple command which finds out what the current branch is and then push the current branch to origin.\ngit push origin $(git branch --show-current) \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; PR Reviews For PR reviews, it is tough to comprehend all the code just by looking on Github. So I like to pull those changes locally. There is a handy script for it that I use. All I run is something like pr.sh 704 origin, so this is pulling PR number 704 from the remote named origin. If you have to pull changes from upstream then specify such or whatever your remote name maybe.\nConfiguration random=\u0026#34;${RANDOM}${RANDOM}\u0026#34; git fetch \u0026#34;${remote}\u0026#34; \u0026#34;pull/${id}/head:pr_${id}_${remote}_${random}\u0026#34; git checkout \u0026#34;pr_${id}_${remote}_${random}\u0026#34; Installation I use my regular framework to install above pr.sh. You can find the entire file here.\nDemo  Step 1: Create branch:  git checkout foobar  Step 2: Make changes as needed. Look at the changes:  gs  Step 3: Add the changes:  git add .  Step 4: Commit these changes:  gcmt  Step 5: Push them:  gpo.sh  Step 6: CI failed, and now you need to make changes. Make necessary fixes and follow step 2 to 3. Then to amend the last commit just run:  gca  Step 7: Look at the git commits in the branch  gl  Step 8: Force push changes now:  gpo.sh -f Conclusion That was my tweaked Git workflow. Let me know your productivity hacks with git, in the comments or on twitter. Thanks for reading. Happy Hacking!\n",

Take a note of the line source \u0026lt;(kubectl completion bash | sed 's/kubectl/k/g').\nwhich kubectl \u0026gt; /dev/null 2\u0026gt;\u0026amp;1 if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then source \u0026lt;(kubectl completion bash) source \u0026lt;(kubectl completion bash | sed \u0026#39;s/kubectl/k/g\u0026#39;) fi NOTE: The above bash-completion has a check for the binary before sourcing its bash-completion code. This is done to avoid the errors like bash: kubectl: command not found... when starting the terminal.\nChanging namespaces I have two functions for this, also added in the ~/.bashrc.\n# find what the current namespace on the cluster is function current-ns() { kubectl get sa default -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.metadata.namespace}\u0026#39; echo } # changing namespace function change-ns() { namespace=$1 if [ -z $namespace ]; then echo \u0026#34;Please provide the namespace name: \u0026#39;change-ns mywebapp\u0026#39;\u0026#34; return 1 fi kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace $namespace } For more information, read my other post on the topic of changing namespace in Kubernetes.\nEasy access scripts For updating kubectl, minikube, helm or kustomize I have scripts which update or download(if the binary is never downloaded) the binaries in place. I wrote a post a few weeks back explaining how I manage my bespoke scripts and binaries.\nThere are other scripts for things that need many flags like starting minikube.\nFind the jsonpath I use the JSON path a lot when trying to get a specific field from the YAML output. Now those of you who don\u0026rsquo;t know what I am talking about, let\u0026rsquo;s say you want to find out what time a pod was created. Then you can query it like this:\n$ kgp kube-proxy-hp7kq -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.metadata.creationTimestamp}\u0026#39; 2020-08-02T10:39:59Z Here I am trying to find out when was the kube-proxy pod created. Now to even construct that JSON path of highly nested fields, it can become cumbersome. So I use a tool called jiq. See the following small video to understand how it is used:\n  Conclusion I hope this was helpful. I don\u0026rsquo;t use any fancy plugins. But there are many ways out there if you are an Ops person dealing with Kubernetes in your diurnal life let me know what your productivity tips with Kubectl and Kubernetes in general are. Happy hacking!\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "Backing up Prometheus??!!",
    "body": "This blog will show you how to take a backup from a running Prometheus and restore it in some other Prometheus instance. You might ask why would you even want to do something like that? Well, sometimes you want the Prometheus metrics because they were collected for some particular purpose and you want to do some analysis later.\nPrerequisites/Assumptions This blog assumes that you have a Prometheus running that is deployed using prometheus-operator in monitoring namespace. But even if you have deployed it in some other way modify the commands in few places.\nSteps Step: Enable Admin API. Find out what is the name of your Prometheus object:\nkubectl -n monitoring get prometheus Set the value of spec.enableAdminAPI to true. Run the following command to do so:\nkubectl -n monitoring patch prometheus prometheus-operator-prometheus \\  --type merge --patch \u0026#39;{\u0026#34;spec\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;enableAdminAPI\u0026#34;:true}}\u0026#39; Step: Verify that the admin API is enabled. $ kubectl -n monitoring get sts prometheus-prometheus-operator-prometheus \\  -o yaml | grep admin - --web.enable-admin-api Step: Verify that the pod is up. Wait for the Prometheus pod to be up. It can take some time to be up if you have a lot of data. Move to next step once all the containers are in READY state.\n$ kubectl -n monitoring get pods prometheus-prometheus-operator-prometheus-0 NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE prometheus-prometheus-operator-prometheus-0 3/3 Running 0 33m Step: Port Forward. Open a separate window to port forward and keep it running in the foreground:\nkubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/prometheus-operator-prometheus 9090 Step: Create a snapshot. Run following command to\n$ curl -XPOST http://localhost:9090/api/v2/admin/tsdb/snapshot {\u0026quot;name\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;20200731T123913Z-6e661e92759805f5\u0026quot;} Step: Locate snapshot. Find the snapshot you have just created in the Prometheus pod. If you have provided the --storage.tsdb.path flag then the snapshot is under:\n\u0026lt;tsdb-dir\u0026gt;/snapshots/\u0026lt;above-dir\u0026gt; To figure out the path just exec into the pod:\n$ kubectl -n monitoring exec -it prometheus-prometheus-operator-prometheus-0 \\  -c prometheus -- /bin/sh -c \\  \u0026#34;ls /prometheus/snapshots/20200731T123913Z-6e661e92759805f5\u0026#34; 01EE25G1ZTKBFBBHFPHNBF99KJ 01EEFF7TE5ENDAGDR5K7ERW3BX ... Step: Copy it locally. Then copy the content from the prometheus container locally by running following command:\nkubectl cp -n monitoring \\  prometheus-prometheus-operator-prometheus-0:/prometheus/snapshots/20200731T123913Z-6e661e92759805f5 \\  -c prometheus . This might take a long time if you have a lot of data.\nStep: Upload it to new Prometheus pod. Delete the data in the existing --storage.tsdb.path. By running following command:\nkubectl -n newprom exec -it prometheus -- /bin/sh -c \u0026#34;rm -rf /prometheus/*\u0026#34; Now upload the old data to the new pod:\nkubectl -n newprom cp ./* prometheus:/prometheus/ NOTE: My new pod\u0026rsquo;s --storage.tsdb.path points to /prometheus.\nI hope this helps, happy hacking!\n",

    "title": "Book Review: Getting Things Done",
    "date": "",
    "description": "The Art of Stress-free Productivity - David Allen",
    "body": "Introduction Recently I completed the book called Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-free Productivity by David Allen. I read the book on my kindle e-reader device, and as the name suggests, it is a self-help category book and about three hundred pages long.\nThe book is an extraordinary walkthrough of how to set up a system that will help you navigate your daily tasks without missing any of them. This system then enables you to patch up the crevices of your memory from which day-to-day tasks fall through.\nIf you have been in a situation where you forget to do something because something urgent was highjacking all the attention? Then this book is an excellent guide for you. The book explains how to build a paper-based task management system, but you can use whatever tool to make a similar system digital or not. I used a tool named Notion for implementing my GTD system.\n Most stress they experience comes from inappropriately managed commitments they make or accept.\n Content and Context The book promises to improve your productivity at the same time, reducing stress about remembering to do the work. This reduced stress frees you to do more work or think about other prospects of your career. In effect, this book not only improves your productivity but also increase your throughput. This book teaches you to break things and tasks into the smallest possible granular actions. These actions can be performed right away if time is allotted to it.\n The very broad and simple definition of a project that I have given (more than one action needed to achieve a desired result) provides an important net to capture the more subtle things that pull or push on your consciousness.\n Author’s primary purpose is to make sure that people don’t rely on their brains to remember stuff. But to use it to do creative work. And he emphasises a lot on doing a mind sweep into an external system and having improved productivity without increased stress. This place where you put all your instant ideas about things to do is called In-basket. And then you process each item from the In-basket by following the flowchart. Each item ends up in one of the final baskets. From these different baskets/queues, you handle the work item according to its own triggers.\nWe generally do things ad-hoc or whatever is consuming our attention the most gets the highest priority. But there are better ways of handling and doing things. This book conveys a better method of planning, queuing and executing jobs. What we don’t realise and nobody tells us is that there are better ways of managing our tasks or things to do. We very well know how to do things we don’t know how to manage them, and it is not taught in any school or college. This book fills that gap!\n Most decisions for action and focus are driven by the latest and loudest inputs, and are based on hope instead of trust.\n The author has worked in this industry of productivity for more than three decades now, which gives him enough credibility and to the methods introduced in the book. He did workshops with top rank executives of companies. There he helped them build their system to channel information, funnel decisions and build a task administration system. This experience has enabled him to tweak, tune and perfect the system of GTD. It is up to the reader to follow the book religiously and create a framework of their own.\nThe author has done a great job in handholding someone new into creating a system from the ground up. And then the author gives tips on how to use the system, how to keep it up to date? How to make sure you don’t lose on information or idea and how to create capture tools.\n Most of us have, in the past seventy-two hours, received more change-producing, project-creating, and priority-shifting inputs than our parents did in a month, maybe even in a year.\n Book Organisation and Tone The book is divided into three parts. The first part is the theoretical explanation of what the system will be like. In the second part, it takes a deeper dive into how to create one. In the third and final part, the author talks from his perspective and how he uses it and what is the ideal time to review the system and some other general tips and tricks.\nThe first part can be challenging to go through. Because it is a lot of theory, and I always felt I should get my hands dirty and start implementing what I am reading. But I went through it all and finally got to the part(second part) where I could do something with the information and implement the knowledge learnt.\nThe book is very relatable. When you set out to create your own GTD system, the author gives so many mental cues that help you clear your mind and dump all the information in it into your system. These mental prompts range from single-word categories to situations that a person might encounter and should put into the system.\n Any “would, could, or should” commitment held only in the psyche creates irrational and unresolvable pressure, 24-7.\n Overall Impression I would prescribe the book to anyone who feels that they are losing their mind over all the stuff they have to do. I was overwhelmed by the tasks I had to do and was not getting to any of them. There were many occurrences where I would forget about doing something only to remember it at the eleventh hour. I was keeping all in my head. Many tasks that were due someday, but I missed deadlines. In other instances, I would get these ideas about things at work or in personal life, really cool ideas, at that moment I would note it down in a note-keeping app as Google Keep or Apple Notes, but there was so little context in them that over time when I looked at these one-liner notes I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t remember what it was all about. These note-keeping apps became dumpsters of ideas whose context was decomposed over time.\nAll this became really frustrating, and that\u0026rsquo;s when I came across this book. I will recommend it to anyone and everyone who wishes to get more done in the same amount of time. The book has helped me set up a system that I can trust to close all my open loops, deliver all the promises made to myself and others.\n The sense of anxiety and guilt doesn’t come from having too much to do; it’s the automatic result of breaking agreements with yourself.\n The author helps anyone reading and obeying the book to build a system to be productive. So if you give time to make the system as you read the book, then you will have something to use at the end of the book. Don’t try to finish the book cover to cover it is more like an instruction manual to follow along. Since I was following along, it took me some time to finish the book. Also, I was watching other videos to implement my system in the tool of my choice, Notion.\n There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.\n For me personally, the system has helped immensely in my work and personal task keeping and making sure that I don’t lose out on something that I need to do. I have felt an enormous boost in my productivity and throughput.\nNow even for unloading the ideas in my moment of creative flashes, I use my GTD system built into Notion. In the spur of the moment, I input the thought from my phone. And later, when I get to my computer, I add more context to the idea that I had. And then decide on what needs to be done with the idea.\nThe book also highlights the significance of checklists. Generally, we tend to remember and try to obtain things to do from our brains. It could be stressful, so it is a good idea to make checklists. I have started making checklists for repeatable stuff now. Like I organise a meetup every month, and this involves many small tasks. Now I have created a checklist with the help of my co-organiser, and this relieves the pressure of managing a meetup. Now we can follow a predefined algorithm/checklist.\n Capability and willingness to instantly make a checklist, accessible and used when needed, is a core component of high-performance self-management.\n My favourite part of the book is implementing the system. I would like to get through part two again and try to get those mental hints to dump anything I still am holding in my head to reduce the cognitive baggage. I want my system to become my second brain.\nThe author has used a lot of epigrams in the middle of the book. I think if those are removed, the book size will reduce considerably. Sometimes they feel out of place. Nothing against the quotes themselves, but I felt it was overdone.\nAnyone who likes to improve their own life by doing things efficiently would like the book. People who are productivity nerds or who are always looking for ways to do tasks more effectively would like the book.\nConclusion Before reading this book, when I didn’t have any system for managing tasks, I used to wander off and waste a lot of time on social media. Now I don’t do it because I always have an action that I need to do next and doing that task and checking it off the list is my source of dopamine now.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t say this is a perfect system of getting things done. But it is one of the effective ones, and I believe having one is beneficial than going with the flow. This book and the system created from it will help you chart your own flow.\nReferences and Links  Goodreads page for the book. My highlights from the book.

    "title": "Framework for managing random scripts and binaries",
    "date": "",
    "description": "This is an explanation of the framework that I have created to manage scripts and binaries.",
    "body": "I always had a conundrum about how to manage the scripts and binaries downloaded randomly from the internet. One way is to put them in the global PATH directory like /usr/local/bin, but I am sceptical about it.\nThere are a couple of things I wanted to solve. How do you update these scripts and binaries? How to do it consistently across all my machines? How to make it easier to have my setup available on any new Linux machine(or even container) I setup? How to do it without sudo?\nManaging random scripts Global scripts I have a Github repository where I have all my scripts and configurations. In the past, I use to copy these scripts into another directory which is in PATH viz. ~/.local/bin. This directory is added to PATH in Fedora by default.\nNow the problem with this copying approach was that if I had to make any corrections to the script because I found a bug. I had to make those changes in two places, one in the Github repository directory and other in the ~/.local/bin directory. As a human would, I use to forget making changes to the Github repository and this use to go out of sync pretty quickly.\nThat is when I thought of creating symlinks. Now all the files stay in the Github repository directory and then this installer script makes a symlink which is stored in ~/.local/bin. Now when I make changes to the script, those changes are in fact, happening in the repository. And whenever I have time I git commit those changes and git push them to Github.\nFor making changes to the scripts I just have to do this:\nvi $(which start-minikube) Local scripts There are scripts that you want to have only locally. Like syncing code to a remote server. These are the scripts you don\u0026rsquo;t want to share with the whole world. For this problem, I have added .scripts directory to the PATH variable in ~/.bashrc. Now anywhere I can create .scripts directory, it is automatically in PATH.\n$ cat ~/.bashrc | grep scripts export PATH=$PATH:.scripts Now with this foundational setup in place, whenever I have a project-specific script, I create a .scripts directory at the root of the project and put that bespoke script in that directory. So it is available for me from the root of the project directory.\nSince I am creating such directories which are unrelated to the project and should not be committed. I have a global entry for ignoring .scripts directory.\n# ignore the local scripts directory .scripts You can find my ~/.bashrc file here.\nProject Specific Scripts There are specific scripts that you want to use only for a project. Now you might wonder why not contribute them to the project itself. There could be scripts to copy code to a remote server; you don\u0026rsquo;t want to contribute such scripts to the project because they are particular to your workflow. In such a case, I have something called a project-specific .scripts directory in the root of the project. Read more about it in detail in this another blog post of mine here.\nManaging random binaries Now many projects ship their binaries off of their Github releases but don\u0026rsquo;t have a package made for an operating system. Now packaging an application for every operating system could be a daunting task for the maintainers of the project, not everyone is willing to take that on their plate(I am grateful those maintainers already working on the open source project I don\u0026rsquo;t expect them to do more work).\nTo manage binaries of such projects, you need your own mechanism of downloading the new versions and replacing older ones. For this again, I rely on my ~/.local/bin directory. Here I put such downloaded binaries. And for the tools that I need regularly, I have created scripts for them. These scripts are managed as explained in the Global scripts section.\nFor example, I use helm regularly, and I need it to be updated as new releases come. So I have a script with following code snippet:\ncurl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-\u0026#34;${version}\u0026#34;-linux-amd64.tar.gz tar -xvzf helm-\u0026#34;${version}\u0026#34;-linux-amd64.tar.gz mv linux-amd64/helm ~/.local/bin/ Now in the above code snippet, I require the user to provide the version. But some tools have consistent naming off of the Github releases so for them I don\u0026rsquo;t require the user to provide the version and finding version is automated as well. For example, the easiest way to find the latest version is using the Github API:\nfunction get_latest_release() { version=$(curl --silent \u0026#34;https://api.github.com/repos/$1/releases/latest\u0026#34; | grep \u0026#39;\u0026#34;tag_name\u0026#34;:\u0026#39; | sed -E \u0026#39;s/.*\u0026#34;([^\u0026#34;]+)\u0026#34;.*/\\1/\u0026#39;) } And use above function like this in my scripts:\nget_latest_release bash/minikube So if you compare the UX for both of them this is how it looks like. One that requires version:\n$ update-helm v3.2.4 + cd /tmp + curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz % Total % Received % Xferd Average Speed Time Time Time Current Dload Upload Total Spent Left Speed 100 12.3M 100 12.3M 0 0 3054k 0 0:00:04 0:00:04 --:--:-- 3055k + tar -xvzf helm-v3.2.4-linux-amd64.tar.gz linux-amd64/ linux-amd64/helm linux-amd64/README.md linux-amd64/LICENSE + mv linux-amd64/helm /home/suraj/.local/bin/ One that does not require version:\n$ update-minikube Downloading minikube v1.12.1 Downloaded successfully in ~/.local/bin/ Setting up a new machine With all that framework in place, whenever I setup a new machine all I need to do is run following commands:\ngit clone https://github.com/surajssd/dotfiles cd dotfiles make install-all That\u0026rsquo;s it!\nWith this simplicity I get all the goodness of the scripts and since this repository also places my custom ~/.bashrc I get all the aliases I use to be productive on shell.\nConclusion You can also setup a similar workflow for your scripts and binaries. This will provide you immense boost in productivity. Also if you have some better way to do same sripts and binaries management please share with me here or on Twitter. Happy Hacking!\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "The Unsettling Similarity of Timeless Dystopian Novel.",
    "body": "The book 1984 was written by Geroge Orwell in 1949 as an attempt to demonstrate how democraries can also fall into the trap of totalitarianism. The story in the book showcases a dystopian world in the year 1984, where there are only three countries in the world, and all of them are in a constant power struggle. All three countries have a totalitarian, oligarchic government of their own. But the story in the book is from a country called Oceania, which is ruled by a party called Ingsoc or English Socialism. This blog is about the similarities of the world in the book 1984 and today. There is no exact present-day equivalent of Ingsoc except, to certain extent, the Communist Party of China.\nSource of image.\nFreedom of Expression, What?  ‘Don’t you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.\n The book states that the Party would expunge history and had complete control over the media viz. print, television, radio. Citizens had no freedom of speech, even thinking against the Party, i.e. thoughtcrime was forbidden and punished by death. Citizens were observed using a television screen all the time, so there is constant surveillance.\n They could spy upon you night and day, but if you kept your head you could still outwit them. With all their cleverness they had never mastered the secret of finding out what another human being was thinking. Perhaps that was less true when you were actually in their hands.\n I think in the present day, the rule that comes closest in the aforementioned aspects is the Chinese government. Even though the Party(Ingsoc) had more diabolical methods of restraining citizens and Chinese ways might be more subtle. The Indian government also has similarity with the control of media — news, movies, national press — to some extent. However, India being a democracy, still has many rights and freedoms(especially freedom of expression, otherwise this blog could get me in trouble) which Indians relish, which is not the case in either China or Oceania. On the aspect of surveillance, most countries are doing it now, and many of them are quite similar to Oceania.\nDistortion of History  And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed—if all records told the same tale—then the lie passed into history and became truth. ‘Who controls the past,’ ran the Party slogan, ‘controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.’\n The Party in Oceania, Ingsoc, also misconstrued facts and history in favour of the Party. They had a Ministry of Truth for handling such forgery. Books, newspaper articles and every written accord were altered to reflect the new reality.\n The past not only changed, but changed continuously.\n The Chinese government has done similar things to purge the account of 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, now no youngsters in China know about the history. The Indian administration has enacted such acts in the past, where they deliberately changed the history to downplay the contributions of the first PM of India Jawaharlal Nehru and defame him.\n And when memory failed and written records were falsified – when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.\n Deliberate hiding of history has happened in the UK as well. The British education system does not teach their school kids the horrors of colonialism and their hegemony over the world. How Victorian England reigned terror and brought atrocities on the native population in their colonies.\nEfface Science  In the end the Party would announce that two and two made five, and you would have to believe it.\n The Party was working on this new language called Newspeak, where they were dismantling down the English language to its bare minimum. In this, they also removed the word Science. And they altered the scientific facts, relegating science to be just a tool for propaganda. For example, they attributed all the past inventions as the inventions of the Party. The only employment of science was in warfare. The familiarity of science became so esoteric that ordinary people had no concern with it whatsoever.\nIn India also the current government has tried to twist scientific discoveries and inventions to create misleading correlations between modern-day devices and the old mythological stories.\nFoment Nationalism to Hide Failures  It was not desirable that the proles should have strong political feelings. All that was required of them was a primitive patriotism which could be appealed to whenever it was necessary to make them accept longer working-hours or shorter rations. And even when they became discontented, as they sometimes did, their discontent led nowhere, because being without general ideas, they could only focus it on petty specific grievances. The larger evils invariably escaped their notice.\n Governments have been using jingoism as a tool to cover their failure and misdeeds; this helps governments in distracting their subjects to other less critical issues. Authorities need a scapegoat where they can divert the hatred of citizens to some other dupe. So they can abscond from their scandals for the time being.\nArousing nationalism is a trick from the old book used repeatedly in history. Nazis used this tool and made Jews as their patsy. Due to the ongoing coronavirus situation, many Chinese have lost their jobs and in fear of an uprising from the citizens the government is being hostile on Indian, Taiwanese, Japanese borders and in South China sea. Also, Chinese government is trying to bedeck its image in the eyes of its citizens by brandishing how barbaric democracies are. Like in the USA, in the light of recent protests of black lives matter, there have been some incidents of violence, and Chinese government propaganda is trying to show that only the violent parts of the whole situation.\nThe Indian government has used similar tactics like doing airstrikes on the Pakistani area to instigate patriotism and gain votes in 2019 elections. It has helped them to put a veil on their inadequacy to thrive the Indian economy, which is plummeting at its highest rate than ever.\n induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship.\n Final Thoughts  the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism.\n All of the above factors help the propaganda machine to function effectively. When it does not work on specific individuals, use force to vaporise (get rid of) them.\n Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.\n Definition of Orwellian Wikipedia:  \u0026ldquo;Orwellian\u0026rdquo; is an adjective describing a situation, idea, or societal condition that George Orwell identified as being destructive to the welfare of a free and open society. It denotes an attitude and a brutal policy of draconian control by propaganda, surveillance, disinformation, denial of truth (doublethink), and manipulation of the past, including the \u0026ldquo;unperson\u0026rdquo;—a person whose past existence is expunged from the public record and memory, practiced by modern repressive governments.\n Ted-Ed:  If they\u0026rsquo;re talking about the deceptive and manipulative use of language, they\u0026rsquo;re on the right track. If they\u0026rsquo;re talking about mass surveillance and intrusive government, they\u0026rsquo;re describing something authoritarian but not necessarily Orwellian. And if they use it as an all-purpose word for any ideas they dislike, it\u0026rsquo;s possible their statements are more Orwellian than whatever it is they\u0026rsquo;re criticizing.\n   References When I read a book I try to find complementary content related to the book in the form or videos on YouTube, blogs or Wikipedia articles about it. This helps me understand the book and the concepts it includes. Especially when the book has a deep impact on the human society. 1984 is book of that kind, the accounts in the book still hold true today to a large extent. At the end of this blog you will find the list of all the videos and other articles that helped me get a good grasp of the book 1984.\nVideos  Crash Course videos     and    Playlist  1984 - George Orwell from Course Hero\n",

    "date": "",
    "description": "Authored by Walter Isaacson",
    "body": "I recently finished this book Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson. And here are my thoughts on the book.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a book that brings the image of Einstein to life.\nAlthough the book is a biography, it makes a reasonable effort in explaining the physics behind his theories of relativity, photoelectric effect and quantum physics. Physics in the book can be intimidating to someone coming from the non-Scientific background. Since it is in the early chapters, one might feel a compulsion to abandon the book. Still, I would urge you to persevere, and the story flows like any novel after that.\nThere are many epigrams stated by Einstein that are worth quoting, and I found them fascinating. His observations of extremism in Germany are very much visible in the present world and in India.\n \u0026ldquo;A foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth\u0026rdquo;\n This statement made a lasting mark on me. This book has definitely made me non-conformist and sceptic of the authority of any kind. Where Einstein later contemplated:\n \u0026ldquo;To punish me for my contempt of authority, Fate has made me an authority myself.\u0026rdquo;\n With so many people associated with Einstein, it is sometimes hard to picture someone against their names. So someone starting the book should go to the end of the book and look at the pictures of people. This will help in making associations easier.\nThe book explains the thought process of Einstein. How he postulated things first and then reached mathematical proof afterwards.\n Einstein\u0026rsquo;s great strength as a theorist was that he had a keener ability than other scientists to come up with what he called \u0026ldquo;the general postulates and principles which serve as the starting point.\u0026rdquo;\n The immense curiosity that Einstein garnered even about the mundane things of everyday life and his non-conformist attitude in questioning long-held beliefs even if they were postulated by venerated people is impressive.\nIn my education about Physics and Chemistry, I have only studied the theories and mathematical formulae postulated by the scientists mentioned in the book. It was a delight to read that they were contemporaries of Einstein and got to know some back story of their own.\nI have highlighted few notes from the book which you can find on the goodreads page.\n",

    "description": "How to watch the traffic of a container or a pod without execing into the pod/contaienr?",
    "body": "Introduction For the reasons of security, many container deployments nowadays run their workloads in a scratch based image. This form of implementation helps reduce the attack surface since there is no shell to gain access to, especially if someone were to break out of the application.\nBut for the developers or operators of such applications, it is hard to debug. Since they lack essential tools or even bash for that matter, but the application\u0026rsquo;s debugging ability should not dictate its production deployment and compromise its security posture.\nThis blog shows one of the many debugging requirements of any connected application, i.e. network snooping or network debugging. I won\u0026rsquo;t emphasise the importance of network debugging in the world of microservices, where containers lead the deployment model.\nNow imagine a scenario where you have an application, statically built based on scratch image and running inside a container. How do you watch the traffic of such an app? You don\u0026rsquo;t have any terminal in that container. You are not allowed to make changes to the environment of the application because this is a production setup. This barebone container image deployment is the exact scenario that this post helps in debugging.\nContainer Scenario For the demo, I have a running application which is doing some networking.\n$ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 241bf66c36c6 fedora \u0026#34;bash\u0026#34; 14 minutes ago Up 14 minutes upbeat_heisenberg The IP address of this application is 172.17.0.2 found using following command:\n$ docker inspect upbeat_heisenberg | grep IPAddress | tail -1 \u0026#34;IPAddress\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;172.17.0.2\u0026#34;, And on the server-side I have the following simple HTTP server running on the host machine:\n$ python3 -m http.server Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ... 172.17.0.2 - - [06/Jun/2020 18:53:18] \u0026#34;GET / HTTP/1.1\u0026#34; 200 - [REDACTED] The IP address of the server is 172.17.0.1 found using the following command:\n$ ip address show docker0 | grep \u0026#39;inet \u0026#39; inet 172.17.0.1/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global docker0 Debugging Now I cannot exec into the container, but I want to see what traffic sent by the application inside the container. Let\u0026rsquo;s find out the PID of the process running inside the container:\n$ docker inspect --format \u0026#39;{{.State.Pid}}\u0026#39; 241bf66c36c6 1371226 Alright, now we know that the process running inside has PID 1371226.

    "title": "Enabling Seccomp on your Prometheus Operator and related Pods",
    "date": "",
    "description": "This post shows how you can enable seccomp on all the Pods that are deployed with Prometheus Operator",
    "body": "Seccomp helps us limit the system calls the process inside container can make. And PodSecurityPolicy is the way to enable it on pods in Kubernetes.\nPrometheus Operator Prometheus Operator makes it really easy to monitor your Kubernetes cluster. To deploy this behemoth, helm chart is the easiest way to do it.\nAlmost all the pods that run as a part of Prometheus Operator viz. Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Kube State Metrics don’t need to run with elevated privileges except Node Exporter. In your Kubernetes cluster if you are using PodSecurityPolicy to make sure that your cluster is secure, then you would want your Prometheus Operator pods to run securely as well. And the good news is, Prometheus Operator chart ships PodSecurityPolicy for each sub-component. We will look at how to enable seccomp for all the sub-components.\nSince these components have their own PSPs, to enable seccomp on the pods you only need to add specific annotations in metadata.annotations. These annotations can help you to select and set the seccomp profiles that is applied to the Pod which is mutated by that PSP. More information on seccomp with PSP is in the Kubernetes docs.\nIn examples below I assume that you are running your workloads on Docker, hence the annotation value is docker/default. If you are running your workloads on other runtimes then use the generic runtime/default policy as mentioned in the docs. There are ways to provide custom seccomp profiles, but it is out of scope of this post.\nKube State Metrics Using Kube State Metrics is the best way to monitor your Kubernetes cluster state. Kube State Metrics chart supports custom PSP annotations which is little different from other components.\nIn the Prometheus Operator helm chart values file add following snippet to enable seccomp to the Kube State Metrics Pods:\nkube-state-metrics: podSecurityPolicy: annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: \u0026#39;docker/default\u0026#39; seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: \u0026#39;docker/default\u0026#39; Once this is added the resultant PSP will have following annotations:\napiVersion: policy/v1beta1 kind: PodSecurityPolicy metadata: name: prometheus-operator-kube-state-metrics annotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: docker/default seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: docker/default Now the Kube State Metrics pod that is mutated by the above PSP will have a seccomp profile that is shipped with Docker.\nPrometheus Operator For workloads Prometheus, Prometheus Operator, Alertmanager here are steps to enable seccomp on those pods. Since Grafana chart already ships pods with seccomp enabled so we don\u0026rsquo;t need any special provisions.\nIn the Prometheus Operator helm chart values file add following snippet:\nglobal: rbac: pspAnnotations: seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames: \u0026#39;docker/default\u0026#39; seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName: \u0026#39;docker/default\u0026#39; This will add above annotations to the PSP metadata.annotations of the aforementioned workloads.\nVerify if seccomp is enabled on a pod To verify if the seccomp is enabled on a pod, you kubectl exec into the pod and run following command:\ncat /proc/self/status | grep Seccomp: If the output is Seccomp:\t2 then seccomp is enabled. If it is Seccomp:\t0 then seccomp is disabled.\nReference Read more in depth about Kubernetes and Seccomp in this blog post.\n",

    "body": "Here are simple steps that you can follow to prove that the root user inside container is also root on the host. And how to mitigate this.\nRoot in container, root on host I have a host with docker daemon running on it. I start a normal container on it with sleep process as PID1. See in the following output that the container clever_lalande started with sleep process.\n$ docker run -d --rm alpine sleep 9999 6c541cf8f7b315783d2315eebc2f7dddd1f7b26f427e182f8597b10f2746ab0b $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 6c541cf8f7b3 alpine \u0026#34;sleep 9999\u0026#34; 12 seconds ago Up 11 seconds clever_lalande Now let\u0026rsquo;s find out the process sleep on the host. Here in the following output you can see that the process sleep is running as user root.\n$ ps aufx | grep sleep USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 4826 0.3 0.0 1552 4 ?

Here I started a new container and forced it to run under the security context of the user core. Here I specify the UID same as the UID on the host. The documentation of the flag says that:\n -u, \u0026ndash;user=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;.\nSets the username or UID used and optionally the groupname or GID for the specified command.\n Here is the container that is started with sleep process named wonderful_proskuriakova.\n$ docker run -d --rm --user ${UID}:${UID} alpine sleep 9999 1cdc11a449e4e62a9557a4d7b586aa320f5512f2746f4a8e1cac7b9e6d2e1225 $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 1cdc11a449e4 alpine \u0026#34;sleep 9999\u0026#34; 25 seconds ago Up 25 seconds wonderful_proskuriakova If I try to find the same process on the host here you can clearly see that the process is not running as root but as user core.\n$ ps aufx | grep sleep USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND core 4607 0.0 0.0 1552 4 ?

You should also drop all the capabilities and whitelist the capabilities that are absolutely needed. Also provide a seccomp profile that is locked down which only allows the syscalls that are needed by your application. There are many times where you want to run as root inside the container in such situations you should use user namespaces, which is what we are looking in the next section.\nRoot inside container, non-root on host Now I have docker daemon which is started with docker user namespace enabled. Look at the flag --userns-remap=default being used to start the docker daemon with user namespace. To know more about enabling user namespace, follow docs here.\n$ systemctl status docker-userns ● docker-userns.service - Docker Application Container Engine Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/docker-userns.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Tue 2019-06-25 07:07:37 UTC; 1h 11min ago Docs: http://docs.docker.com Main PID: 4011 (dockerd) Tasks: 10 Memory: 61.8M CGroup: /system.slice/docker-userns.service └─4011 /run/torcx/bin/dockerd --host=fd:// --host=tcp://127.0.0.1:2376 --containerd=/var/run/docker/libcontainerd/docker-containerd.sock --userns-remap=default --pidfile /var/run/docker-userns.pid --selinux-enabled=true ... Now start the container like we did for the first time without any --user flag. In the following output you can see that the container started with name sad_pasteur.\n$ docker run --rm -d alpine sleep 9999 05290a7088b3e7c0e4e80cbb3a63c0d63a49627b8d31ec9f75f44b9a57b717f4 $ docker ps CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES 05290a7088b3 alpine \u0026#34;sleep 9999\u0026#34; 2 seconds ago Up 1 second sad_pasteur Now if we see the sleep process on host, the process has started with different user 100000 on host.\n$ ps aufx | grep sleep USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND 100000 5467 0.2 0.0 1552 4 ?

This mapping of the user id on host and inside the container can be found in the following files:\n$ cat /etc/subuid dockremap:100000:65536 $ cat /etc/subgid dockremap:100000:65536 References  Docker Lab: User Namespaces Isolate containers with a user namespace  ",

    "body": "There are always scripts that you write to automate some mundane tasks. And then you put that script in a directory that is in your PATH. But what this does is that it pollutes your system global PATH and shows up in places you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want it to be in.\nI was struggling with this issue for a while and struggling to get a proper solution. But there is a very simple and clever trick to solve this problem. You extend your PATH to have a relative path .scripts in it. Like following (this is a snippet from my .bashrc).\nexport PATH=$PATH:.scripts And also add this directory to your global gitignore file. This should be done so that when you put this .scripts directory in your project the git should ignore it and not look at it as the change you would want to push to the git repository. Here is a snippet from my gitignore file.\n$ grep scripts ~/.gitignore 17:# ignore the local scripts directory 18:.scripts Now on what you can do is put the scripts you want to be available in a particular project into a directory called .scripts. Like for example:\n$ ll -a drwxrwxr-x@ - surajd 17 Jun 14:38 .scripts/ drwxrwxr-x@ - surajd 4 Jun 15:51 .terraform/ .rw-rw-r--@ 162 surajd 11 Jun 14:03 locals.tf $ ll .scripts/ .rwxrwxr-x@ 141 surajd 14 Jun 12:00 redeploy.sh* Now you can see that whenever I am in this directory redeploy.sh is available for me to run. When I press tab key the autocomplete shows up the results.\n$ red\u0026lt;tab\u0026gt; red redeploy.sh Now I just create those scripts directories and my global PATH is not polluted and it makes me happy.\nI have penned down the other aspects of scripts management in my post called: Framework for managing random scripts and binaries.\n",

    "description": "Dealing with apiserver in minikube can be tricky",
    "body": "If you want to provide extra flags to the kube-apiserver that runs inside minikube how do you do it? You can use the minikube\u0026rsquo;s --extra-config flag with apiserver.\u0026lt;apiserver flag\u0026gt;=\u0026lt;value\u0026gt;, for e.g. if you want to enable RBAC authorization mode you do it as follows:\n--extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=RBAC So this is a no brainer when doing it for flags whose value can be given right away, like the one above. But what if you want to provide value which is a file path. Because you will have to make that file available for apiserver. And this apiserver runs as a static pod inside minikube. How do you make the file available to that process inside pod inside minikube?\nThe solution is little tricky and not very straight forward. The api-server pod mounts minikube\u0026rsquo;s /var/lib/minikube/certs/ directory in the pod at location /var/lib/minikube/certs/. Make the file available at this location. When enabling that flag for apiserver provide file location of this directory.\nTo make this step easier I have filed an issue in minikube upstream kubernetes/minikube/3559.\nFollow this tutorial on how to do this. In this tutorial I want to make the EncryptionConfiguration file available for apiserver to enable encryption of secret data at rest. This is the first step to the tasks from kubernetes docs as mentioned here.\n Start minikube normally To make the file needed available in the machine start minikube normally. For that run following command:\nminikube start \\ --vm-driver kvm2 \\ --kubernetes-version v1.13.2 \\ --cpus 3 --memory 3000 \\ --extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=RBAC \\ --v 10 You can make required changes to the above commmand lke change the --vm-driver or --cpus or --memory, as per your needs.\nMake file available inside minikube Run following command to go into machine\nminikube ssh Once inside machine become root by running sudo -i. And then create the config file needed that will be passed to the apiserver. For my needs I wanted to create a EncryptionConfiguration.\nRun following command to make the config file available.\necho \u0026#34; kind: EncryptionConfiguration apiVersion: apiserver.config.k8s.io/v1 resources: - resources: - secrets providers: - aescbc: keys: - name: key1 secret: fPLrjJNkbuLmh2aqOsCR5sZV+/Wqhi8CdMrgceaKR3E= - identity: {} \u0026#34; | tee /var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml See the location of the file it is in /var/lib/minikube/certs. In above command you can change it to the config you would want to make available for apiserver.\nRestart minikube Exit out of the minikube vm and get to your host machine and run following:\nminikube stop minikube start \\ --vm-driver kvm2 \\ --kubernetes-version v1.13.2 \\ --cpus 3 --memory 3000 \\ --extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=RBAC \\ --extra-config=apiserver.encryption-provider-config=/var/lib/minikube/certs/encryptionconfig.yaml \\ --v 10 Again make changes to the apiserver flag and file name if needed according to your needs. Now you should have apiserver started without problems.\n",

    "title": "Cobra and Persistentflags gotchas",
    "date": "",
    "description": "How wrong usage of persistent flags can burn you",
    "body": "If you are using cobra cmd line library for golang applications and it\u0026rsquo;s PersistentFlags and if you have a use case where you are adding same kind of flag in multiple places. You might burn your fingers in that case, if you keep adding it in multiple sub-commands without giving it a second thought. To understand what is really happening and why it is happening follow along.\nAll the code referenced here can be found here https://github.com/surajssd/cobrademo.\nThe cmd line tool built with cobra has following structure. The main tool is called cobrademo. And the sub-commands are alpha and num. Sub-command num has one more sub-command called one.\ncobrademo ├── alpha └── num └── one Now I want a persistent flag --config to be availabe under sub-command one and alpha both. So I created a func that allows me to add this flag under any command, which looked like following:\nfunc addConfig(cmd *cobra.Command) { // add config flag \tcmd.PersistentFlags().String( \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;, os.ExpandEnv(\u0026#34;$HOME/.config\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;Path to config file\u0026#34;) viper.BindPFlag(\u0026#34;config\u0026#34;, cmd.PersistentFlags().Lookup(\u0026#34;config\u0026#34;)) } Above code is here.\nNow this is called from one.go and alpha.go to add the flag under those sub-command.\nNow the command structure for alpha sub-command looks like following:\n$ go run main.go alpha -h All the alphabet related commands Usage: cobrademo alpha [flags] Flags: --config string Path to config file (default \u0026#34;/home/hummer/.config\u0026#34;) -h, --help help for alpha For sub-command one it looks like following:\n$ go run main.go num -h All the numeric related commands Usage: cobrademo num [command] Available Commands: one first subcommand in numerics Flags: -h, --help help for num Use \u0026#34;cobrademo num [command] --help\u0026#34; for more information about a command. $ go run main.go num one -h first subcommand in numerics Usage: cobrademo num one [flags] Flags: --config string Path to config file (default \u0026#34;/home/hummer/.config\u0026#34;) -h, --help help for one But if you look at the functionality it does not work as expected.\n$ go run main.go num one --config=foobar inside one, config value: foobar $ go run main.go alpha --config=foobar inside alpha, config value: /home/hummer/.config If you see the output of both the commands it is different. While it should have been same i.e. foobar. What made it work in case of sub-command one and it did not work in case of sub-command alpha?\nNow we are registering a persistent flag twice once for sub-command one and again for alpha. And these calls happen from the init func of those files. If you look at the order of the evaluation of those init functions then it happens in alphabetical order.\n$ tree cmd/ cmd/ ├── alpha.go ├── num.go ├── one.go └── root.go Hence the init func of alpha is called first and the flag config is registered there first and again it is registered for one. So the final flag is just registered for one. Hence the functionality works correctly for one and not for alpha.\nSo the right way to work with persistent flags is to register them only once. If any particular sub-command tree needs that flag then only register at it\u0026rsquo;s root. In our case most of the sub-commands will need it, so the right way to use it is to add it to the rootCmd.\nIn above code I removed the function addConfig and all it\u0026rsquo;s references(see the changes here). And added following code snippet to the init func of root.go.\n// add config flag \trootCmd.PersistentFlags().String( \u0026#34;config\u0026#34;, os.ExpandEnv(\u0026#34;$HOME/.config\u0026#34;), \u0026#34;Path to config file\u0026#34;) viper.BindPFlag(\u0026#34;config\u0026#34;, rootCmd.PersistentFlags().Lookup(\u0026#34;config\u0026#34;)) And now after running the code again with above changes it works absolutely fine:\n$ go run main.go num one --config=foobar inside one, config value: foobar $ go run main.go alpha --config=foobar inside alpha, config value: foobar There are other cobra gotchas that exist but then that is for another post.\n",

    "body": "I enabled PodSecurityPolicy on a minikube cluster by appending PodSecurityPolicy to the apiserver flag in minikube like this:\n--extra-config=apiserver.enable-admission-plugins=Initializers,NamespaceLifecycle,\\  LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,\\  NodeRestriction,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,\\  ResourceQuota,PodSecurityPolicy Ideally when you have PSP enabled and if you don\u0026rsquo;t define any PSP and authorize it with right RBAC no pod will start in the cluster. But what I saw was that there were some pods still running in kube-system namespace.\n$ kubectl -n kube-system get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE coredns-576cbf47c7-g2t8v 1/1 Running 4 5d11h etcd-minikube 1/1 Running 2 5d11h heapster-bn5xp 1/1 Running 2 5d11h influxdb-grafana-qzpv4 2/2 Running 4 5d11h kube-addon-manager-minikube 1/1 Running 2 5d11h kube-controller-manager-minikube 1/1 Running 1 4d20h kube-scheduler-minikube 1/1 Running 2 5d11h kubernetes-dashboard-5bb6f7c8c6-9d564 1/1 Running 8 5d11h storage-provisioner 1/1 Running 7 5d11h Which got me thinking what is wrong with the way PSPs work. So if you look closely only two pods are scheduled by a deployment.\n$ kubectl get deploy NAME DESIRED CURRENT UP-TO-DATE AVAILABLE AGE coredns 1 1 1 1 5d11h kubernetes-dashboard 1 1 1 0 5d11h These pods were already scheduled and worked fine before, Kubernetes was just trying to restart them.

But once a pod is deleted and is up for re-scheduling again it will fail with something like above.\nSo to enable it on the running cluster here is what the Kubernetes documentation says:\n Since the pod security policy API (policy/v1beta1/podsecuritypolicy) is enabled independently of the admission controller, for existing clusters it is recommended that policies are added and authorized before enabling the admission controller.\n ",

    "body": "I passed CKA exam with 92% marks on 19th October 2018.\nA lot of folks are curious about how to prepare and what resources to follow. Here is my list of things to do and list of resources that might help you on successful CKA exam.\nThe duration of exam is three hours, which is enough time if you do good practice. The exam is pretty straight forward and tests your Kubernetes hands-on knowledge, so whatever you read please try to do it on a real cluster.\nYou have access to Kubernetes docs during the exam so make sure you go through Kubernetes documentation thoroughly. Once you are familiar with the documentation you will know where to look at if you need to refer something.\nNote: I have not read any book on Kubernetes or followed any professional training. Other people do recommend reading books which might be helpful but again do follow those books/courses with more preference to hands-on practice.\nYour Kubernetes cluster For me the go-to place for a cluster has always been either Katacoda\u0026rsquo;s Kubernetes Playground or my local machine with minikube installed on it. This sufficed most of my use cases but if you want to have a multi-node setup with networking and everything kubeadm is a quick way to setup a new cluster.\nThings you must do hands-on   Kubernetes the hard way by Kelsey Hightower. This tutorial setup is on GCP, but if you want you can also do it locally by setting up machines using Vagrant or something similar. I personally always did this setup on my local machine using Vagrant(The explanation about my setup can go in another post though).\n  Kubernetes Tasks from docs, just don\u0026rsquo;t blindly do the tasks. Most tasks have link to the concepts of what is being done. Follow those links and read up.\n  Things you must read  Kubernetes Concepts Kubernetes Reference Basics of systemd, like starting, restarting and enabling the service. And how to read the systemd service file.  Other resources   You should focus on imperative style of using Kubernetes; for that thoroughly read up and practice following posts:\n Overview of kubectl Managing Resources Managing Kubernetes Objects Using Imperative Commands kubectl Cheat Sheet    This github repo by Walid Shaari is a really good source of finding right resources to read according to the syllabus distribution.\n  Learn to generate resouces on the fly with kubectl create .... This will help you in not having to write entire kubernetes resouce yaml file by hand, which can be tedious and erroneous task. Whenever you are running those commands and are confused about it\u0026rsquo;s usage kubectl create -h gives you examples of various usages of the command.\n  You don\u0026rsquo;t need to remember the location of systemd service files, the trick I use to find the location of service file is just try to see the status of service by running systemctl status \u0026lt;service name\u0026gt; and in there you will see the location to service file that is loaded.\n  During exam   Make yourself familiar with tmux, this helps if you like having split screen while working.\n  Having a decent sized monitor for exam can help if you have problem with small font size and having to fit everything in one small laptop window, but then this will also imply that you will need external webcam.\n  The exam is supported on Chrome only and if you are used to using the shortcut on terminal to delete word Ctrl + W, which also happens to close the chrome window tab then you might want to remove that shortcut. Here is what I did on my system to disable the shortcut during the exam.\n  The first thing to do after exam starts, enable kubectl auto-completion in exam terminal by running source \u0026lt;(kubectl completion bash).\n   With all that said, I will try to keep this document alive by adding things if I remember any, otherwise always feel free to reach out to me on twitter @surajd_. Also join the Kubernauts community where people are really helpful with your queries.\n",

But the same shortcut in browser can close a tab. Since this exam is combination of both I am afraid I might close my exam tab while deleting a word in terminal. Now the only solution to this is disabling the shortcut in chrome. But turns out that the shortcut is hard coded in chrome.\nI use Fedora Linux with GNOME as my desktop environment. So the alternative to this problem is you just add this keybinding as a no operation in GNOME. So I am going to add this as a no-op till the exam and remove this once I am done with the exam. So here are the steps to do it.\nSteps to disable \u0026ldquo;Ctrl + W\u0026rdquo; Open Keyboard in your Settings, you can just type in the GNOME search.\nOnce you open Keyboard you can see bunch of shortcuts listed there.\nGoto the bottom of it and click on the plus button.\nNow you can add a custom shortcut here, Name it something so that you remember that you want to remove it later and in Command put some no-op thing. After that click on Set Shortcut to provide key binding.\nType key combination of Ctrl + W here\nYour custom shortcut should look like this, and click the Add button.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s how you will have your Ctrl + W disabled.\n",

    "body": "There is no easy way to change namespace in Kubernetes using kubectl command line utility. But here are some commands that you can alias in your bashrc file so that it\u0026rsquo;s just a single command that you can use to change the namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.\nChange namespace Let\u0026rsquo;s see step by step what goes in to change the namespace. So the first step is to find the context.\n A context element in a kubeconfig file is used to group access parameters under a convenient name. Each context has three parameters: cluster, namespace, and user. By default, the kubectl command-line tool uses parameters from the current context to communicate with the cluster. Read more.\n $ kubectl config current-context minikube Now I have a namespace which I have created and want to switch to it.\n$ kubectl create ns mywebapp namespace \u0026#34;mywebapp\u0026#34; created Now we have two needed information to change the current default namespace, context and namespace name.\n$ kubectl config set-context minikube --namespace mywebapp Context \u0026#34;minikube\u0026#34; modified. Notice that we have put the context here as minikube and namespace name as we have created, mywebapp.\nSo this can be put in one command and used conveniently. Just copy following bash function into your bashrc file and you will have change-ns as a command available.\nfunction change-ns() { namespace=$1 if [ -z $namespace ]; then echo \u0026#34;Please provide the namespace name: \u0026#39;change-ns mywebapp\u0026#39;\u0026#34; return 1 fi kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace $namespace } Verify change of namespace How do you verify that the namespace is changed? How do you find what is the current namespace? Run following command:\nkubectl get sa default -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.metadata.namespace}\u0026#39; Let\u0026rsquo;s deconstruct that. Every namespace that is created has a ServiceAccount created by default with name default (Read more).\nFor any object/artifact in Kubernetes there is a field called namespace inside it\u0026rsquo;s metadata field. Which tells you about what namespace a particular object is part of. If you don\u0026rsquo;t set it while creating, Kubernetes will set it to the current default namespace. So this is a source of knowing what current namespace is.\nLook at following pod object definition, the namespace for pod storage-provisioner is kube-system.\n$ kubectl get pod storage-provisioner -o yaml apiVersion: v1 kind: Pod metadata: creationTimestamp: 2018-06-10T09:56:24Z name: storage-provisioner namespace: kube-system ... Now you can use the flag -o with jsonpath type of input to tell what specific object you would like to fetch information about, in our case we want metadata.namespace.\nThe above command can also be converted to one command, just add following snippet to bashrc and you will have a command current-ns.\nfunction current-ns() { kubectl get sa default -o jsonpath=\u0026#39;{.metadata.namespace}\u0026#39; echo } Hope that helps, you with being productive with Kubernetes.

UserPtr has worked for 6 hrs. If we call this method on value type object uval it works, and obviously it works with pointer type object pval.\nValue receiver Now we change the method receiver from pointer to value.\ntype User struct { Name string Period int } func (u User) Work() { fmt.Println(u.Name, \u0026#34;has worked for\u0026#34;, u.Period, \u0026#34;hrs.\u0026#34;) } func main() { uval := User{\u0026#34;UserVal\u0026#34;, 5} uval.Work() pval := \u0026amp;User{\u0026#34;UserPtr\u0026#34;, 6} pval.Work() } See on go playground.\noutput:\nUserVal has worked for 5 hrs. UserPtr has worked for 6 hrs. So this also worked on both value type object uval and with pointer type object pval.\nInterface and pointer receiver Lets try to add interface in the mix and see what happens, so adding interface Worker to pointer receiver method:\ntype User struct { Name string Period int } type Worker interface { Work() } func (u *User) Work() { fmt.Println(u.Name, \u0026#34;has worked for\u0026#34;, u.Period, \u0026#34;hrs.\u0026#34;) } func main() { uval := User{\u0026#34;UserVal\u0026#34;, 5} DoWork(uval) pval := \u0026amp;User{\u0026#34;UserPtr\u0026#34;, 6} DoWork(pval) } func DoWork(w Worker) { w.Work() } See on go playground.\noutput:\n# command-line-arguments tmp/main.go:20:8: cannot use uval (type User) as type Worker in argument to DoWork: User does not implement Worker (Work method has pointer receiver) So pointer type object pval implements interface Worker, but value type object uval does not. Since the error clearly says\nUser does not implement Worker (Work method has pointer receiver) To understand why this above code fails, you need to understand the concept of method sets. Golang spec defines Method sets as:\n The method set of any other type T consists of all methods declared with receiver type T.\n and\n The method set of the corresponding pointer type *T is the set of all methods declared with receiver *T or T (that is, it also contains the method set of T).\n finally\n The method set of a type determines the interfaces that the type implements and the methods that can be called using a receiver of that type.\n In above example the method with pointer receiver is not in method set of value type object uval.\nInterface and value receiver Now lets try the same inteface but this time with value receiver:\ntype User struct { Name string Period int } type Worker interface { Work() } func (u User) Work() { fmt.Println(u.Name, \u0026#34;has worked for\u0026#34;, u.Period, \u0026#34;hrs.\u0026#34;) } func main() { uval := User{\u0026#34;UserVal\u0026#34;, 5} DoWork(uval) pval := \u0026amp;User{\u0026#34;UserPtr\u0026#34;, 6} DoWork(pval) } func DoWork(w Worker) { w.Work() } See on go playground.\noutput:\nUserVal has worked for 5 hrs. UserPtr has worked for 6 hrs. Meanwhile the method with value receiver worked for both type of objects pointer type object pval and value type object uval.\nSo here is a table which charts this behavior:\n   scenario object value object pointer     pointer method yes yes   value method yes yes   interface pointer method no yes   interface value method yes yes    More on the case of why code compilation fails or compiler complains about value type object uval not implementing the interface Worker.\nReferences  Method sets in golang spec Methods, Interfaces and Embedded Types in Go  ",

    "body": "I am doing Kubernetes native development using minikube. And for doing that I had to download a Container image that is available in internally hosted private container registry.\nOn the configuration side of doing that you will need to create Kubernetes Secret of type docker-registry. And now refer that secret you just created in your Pod manifest under pod.spec.imagePullSecrets. For more info follow the tutorial in Kubernetes docs on Pull an Image from a Private Registry.\nBut this did not help me in pulling image from the private registry, I was getting error as follows:\n$ kubectl get events -w LASTSEEN FIRSTSEEN COUNT NAME KIND SUBOBJECT TYPE REASON SOURCE MESSAGE ... 2017-10-06 18:46:11 +0530 IST 2017-10-06 18:40:17 +0530 IST 30 private-reg Pod Warning FailedSync kubelet, minikube Error syncing pod 2017-10-06 18:46:23 +0530 IST 2017-10-06 18:40:17 +0530 IST 31 private-reg Pod Warning FailedSync kubelet, minikube Error syncing pod 2017-10-06 18:46:23 +0530 IST 2017-10-06 18:40:18 +0530 IST 24 private-reg Pod spec.containers{private-reg-container} Normal BackOff kubelet, minikube Back-off pulling image \u0026#34;my-cool-registry.com/surajd-images/busybox:1.26.2\u0026#34; ... Here private-reg is the pod name and my-cool-registry.com/surajd-images/busybox:1.26.2 is the image name.\nThe registry uses an identity certificate that is issued by company\u0026rsquo;s internal root CA. Your minikube VM needs to trust this root CA in order to work properly with the internal registry. This is where I realized that I had to download the CA cert.\nSo download the cert and dump it inside the VM, running following command:\n$ certificatefile=\u0026lt;your-ca-crt-file\u0026gt; $ registryserver=\u0026lt;your-registry-server\u0026gt; $ cat $certificatefile | minikube ssh \u0026#34;sudo mkdir -p /etc/docker/certs.d/$registryserver\u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo tee /etc/docker/certs.d/$registryserver/ca.crt\u0026#34; ^C Note: You will have to press Ctrl + C, it should have done writing!\nNow you are fully ready to pull the image from this private registry.

Where he talked about containerized storage vs traditional storage, instead of building clustering into OpenEBS how they are leveraging Kubernetes\u0026rsquo;s capabilities to do clustering.\nHe also explained difference between various storage providers viz. Portworx, StorageOS, Rook, GlusterFS, OpenEBS, etc.\nThen was talk by Kamesh Sampath on Istio named A sail in the cloud. Specifically tracing, monitoring, service discovery with Istio.\nHe explained the Istio Service Mesh architecture and all components it has. How side-car pattern is being used to deploy Istio with the existing apps in Kubernetes.\nHe talked and demoed about Canary deployment, tracing and Circuit breaking with Istio. Watch the video recording of talk by Kamesh to learn in detail. Here is his demo content.\nAfter a snacks break, there was a talk by Zeeshan Ahmed about Dance of container image building. The main highlight of this highly interactive session was on best practices to be followed for building container images.\nWhere he explained why it is not a good idea to bake configs and secrets into container image and how one can use use Kubernetes secrets and configMaps to get this configs and secrets in the container on the fly, he then demoed the tool buildah where you don\u0026rsquo;t need a docker daemon to build the container image.\nFollowed by Zeeshan was talk by Saravanakumar where he talked about Source to Image in OpenShift, where he explained what is s2i, how you can use s2i with the running OpenShift cluster by directly providing github url of a project and see it deployed on OpenShift.\nThen he demonstrated how you can build your own builder image for OpenShift s2i. Link to slides.\nThe meetup ended with announcements of Kubernetes Birthday meetup and awesome burgers from Truffles sponsored by OpenEBS.

    "body": "\u0026ldquo;One does not simply deploy containers to production\u0026rdquo;\nWith the rising craze around the container community in Bangalore and relative lack in awareness around different container technologies like Kubernetes and OpenShift, an effort was made in imparting knowledge in this direction.\nSo, this time around newbies were targeted for the Kubernetes Meetup.\nWith the above objective, it was decided to have a Kubernetes 101 workshop at Red Hat Bangalore office on May 21, 2017 to familiarize people with concepts of Kubernetes and OpenShift and their usage and relevance as container orchestration tools for managing application deployments.\nThe schedule for the Meetup was as follows:\n Kubernetes 101 - Knowing the terms in Kubernetes Kubernetes 101 - Hands-on workshop OpenShift 101 - What OpenShift adds to Kubernetes? OpenShift 101 - Hands-on workshop  As per the schedule, we opened the floor with a talk by Hemani Katyal on Kubernetes Basics(slides), wherein she explained the need for Kubernetes, what it is, it\u0026rsquo;s architecture, why Kubernetes would be better container orchestrator and the constructs of Kubernetes like pods, volumes, labels, replications controllers, services, etc.\nIt was good to see people interested in concepts of service and the way it load balances traffic, how the labels construct is helpful in bringing in flexibility with deployments, why Kubernetes is better than other container orchestrators.\nFollowing up with the excitement, Suraj Deshmukh, Abhishek Singh, Zeeshan Ahmed and Shubham Minglani happily volunteered to conduct the hands-on workshop. The workshop exercises were taken from Kubernetes section of katacoda.com.\nIt was pleasure to have an excited and responsive audience. Questions like kube-adm functionality on CentOS, installing Kubernetes in an isolated environment without internet, how ingress works and the likes of the same were asked during the hands-on session.\nPost a quick coffee break, Abhishek Singh briefed the audience about OpenShift basics(slides), wherein he explained what OpenShift is and how it is an addon on top of Kubernetes. He touched upon topics like user management, various build features of OpenShift, container image handling in OpenShift, the way deployment fits in with build part, security, running OpenShift locally using Minishift, to name a few.\nSatiating the hunger not just for knowledge but food as well, we broke for lunch.\nPost which we continued with OpenShift hand-on exercises, which were again from OpenShift section of katacoda.com. Zeeshan Ahmed, Suraj Narwade and Abhishek Singh helped with the workshop exercises. There seemed to be lot of interest around topics like the source to image feature of OpenShift, if OpenShift’s router allowed UDP traffic, the difference between ingress and routes.\nRed Hat’s latest announcement regarding the integration of AWS services with OpenShift also generated some curiosity among the audience.\nThe meetup concluded asking for feedback and distributing some swag. In feedback we received, people wanted to see some real world examples, the kind of applications that run on these platforms, and much more which are advanced topics and we would love to take up in normal meetup as opposed to a 101.\nI would like to conclude here by thanking all speakers, volunteers for spreading knowledge, katacoda.com for awesome workshop material and audience for listening patiently and trying out things and making this meetup successful. And last but not the least, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to Red Hat for sponsoring the event and providing us with the venue and Hemani Katyal for making this post an awesome read.\nLinks  Kubernetes DIY hands-on exercises https://www.katacoda.com/courses/kubernetes OpenShift DIY hands-on exercises https://learn.openshift.com/  ",

    "body": "I want to show how you can enable Kubernetes in your day to day development workflow. So that you get the feel of production deployment locally from day 1.\nI have a flask application which I am working on. The basic directory structure looks like this:\n$ ll total 24 -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 427 Apr 23 16:23 app.py -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 201 Apr 23 16:55 docker-compose.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 363 Apr 23 16:21 Dockerfile -rwxrwxr-x. 1 foo foo 82 Dec 5 19:41 entrypoint.sh -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 3010 Dec 5 19:41 README.adoc -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 11 Dec 5 19:41 requirements.txt You can find all of these files in this github repo.\nFor having a local cluster I am using minikube. So follow instructions to setup minikube. Once you follow the instructions you will have a vm running a single node kubernetes cluster and a locally available kubectl binary.\nBefore running this application on the minikube cluster we need configurations that kubernetes understands. Since we already have docker-compose file we will generate configs from this file with the help from tool called kompose. Install kompose as per instructions as given on docs.\nGenerating configs:\n$ mkdir configs $ kompose convert -o configs/ WARN Kubernetes provider doesnt support build key - ignoring INFO file \u0026#34;configs/hitcounter-service.yaml\u0026#34; created INFO file \u0026#34;configs/redis-service.yaml\u0026#34; created INFO file \u0026#34;configs/hitcounter-deployment.yaml\u0026#34; created INFO file \u0026#34;configs/redis-deployment.yaml\u0026#34; created Before we deploy the app we need to make some changes in the deployment files, that were converted from docker-compose service having build construct in them. In our case only python app hitcounter is built is being built from Dockerfile.\nWe will edit file hitcounter-deployment.yaml in configs directory, to not pull image but read image from the local docker storage. Add a field after image called imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent. Make changes as shown in following diff:\n$ git diff diff --git a/configs/hitcounter-deployment.yaml b/configs/hitcounter-deployment.yaml index 7b1116d..0ef35b3 100644 --- a/configs/hitcounter-deployment.yaml +++ b/configs/hitcounter-deployment.yaml @@ -17,6 +17,7 @@ spec:  - name: REDIS_HOST value: redis image: hitcounter + imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent  name: hitcounter ports: - containerPort: 5000 Now we are ready with the configs, but we need to build container image for our app. So here you will need to have docker-compose installed on your machine. For that follow docs here.\nBuild image in the minikube\neval $(minikube docker-env) docker-compose build Once the build is complete, we are good to the deployment in kubernetes.\n$ kubectl create -f configs/ deployment \u0026#34;hitcounter\u0026#34; created service \u0026#34;hitcounter\u0026#34; created deployment \u0026#34;redis\u0026#34; created service \u0026#34;redis\u0026#34; created To verify that the app is running, find out the exposed IP Address as follows:\n$ kubectl get svc NAME CLUSTER-IP EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S) AGE hitcounter 10.0.0.244 \u0026lt;pending\u0026gt; 5000:30476/TCP 6s kubernetes 10.0.0.1 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 443/TCP 3d redis 10.0.0.21 \u0026lt;none\u0026gt; 6379/TCP 6s Now hit the externally exposed port 30476 of service hitcounter as:\n$ curl $(minikube ip):30476 Now everytime you make changes to code do the following:\ndocker-compose build kubectl scale deployment hitcounter --replicas=0 kubectl scale deployment hitcounter --replicas=1 Above we are removing all containers with old image and asking it to use the new image. For OpenShift we can do oc deploy hitcounter --latest and it will trigger the deployment but I could not find anything similar with kubernetes.\nFAQ   - Why do I need to make changes in the kompose generated configs?\nBecause by the default the config that kompose generates will not set imagePullPolicy and hence Kubernetes assumes its value to be Always. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t make changes and try to deploy then Kubernetes will try to find the image from docker hub. Which it won\u0026rsquo;t find and then that deployment will fail. So we need to tell Kubernetes to look for the image in local docker storage.\n  - Can I use the same configs in the production servers as well?\nYes you can use it just remove the change we did in the imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent. The change is done to enable you to use the locally built images without having to push the image to any container registry.\n  - How do I get images when I am deploying in production level cluster?\nMake sure your cluster can pull images from some private container registry. And then set up a build pipeline from your code repo to build container on every change of it\u0026rsquo;s stable branch.\n  - I have build defined in my docker-compose service why do I need to mention image name?\nWith docker-compose this is okay. But kompose cannot make up a name on it\u0026rsquo;s own and create deployment. The issue is tracked in kompose. But for now with build also provide the image name you would expect.\n  - I get error running docker commands with minikube?\nIf you face problem accessing the docker daemon running inside the minikube VM like one of this\n$ eval $(minikube docker-env) $ docker ps could not read CA certificate \u0026#34;/etc/docker/ca.pem\u0026#34;: open /etc/docker/ca.pem: no such file or directory This could be because there is a mismatch in docker client and docker daemon version, so to solve this issue just copy the docker client from the minikube VM to the local machine.\nEnter in the VM\nminikube ssh Copy the binary to host machine\nscp $(which docker) foo@192.168.122.1:/home/foo/ Now put the binary in PATH.\n  If you have any other questions please ask it, I would like to add those here in FAQ section.\n",

Also, leaving behind a note on how one could reach out to the developers and contribute to Minishift. Link to slides, video.\nLast, but not the least, planned talk was by Suraj Narwade on running Docker on ARM/Raspberry PI, wherein he enjoyed sharing his experience of working on his hobby project, and all the problems faced by him in trying to get containers running on Raspberry PI. He shared his discovery showcasing the incompatibility of the container images built on x86_64, to run on arm. Link to slides, video.\nFinally, an unanticipated lightening talk took the audience by storm where a quick 3 minutes demo on Persistent Storage with Kubernetes by Raghavendra Talur turned into a good discussion of 30 minutes. He demo-ed, hyper-converged storage and dynamic provisioning with gluster and answered a lot of queries regarding setting up storage with Kubernetes, finishing on a to be continued note in the successive meetup.\nThe meetup concluded with discussion over snacks and planning for the next chapter of this meetup, which will be a Kubernetes and OpenShift 101 workshop for beginners.\nThanks to all the Speakers for sharing their valuable thoughts and learnings, Baiju for recording all the sessions, Hemani for making this post a good read and Red Hat for the venue.\nThe meetup is also featured on K8sPort, which is community engagement platform for Kubernetes community, courtesy Ryan Quackenbush.\n",

    "body": "Notes about using git.\nTips and tricks  Switch branches $ git checkout \u0026lt;branch\u0026gt;  status $ git status -sb Show status in short format and also give branch info\n show $ git show Shows log message and diff about the commit you are on.\n log $ git log -L 70,100:pkg/transformer/kubernetes/kubernetes.go Get logs on file between line numbers.\n$ git log --graph --abbrev-commit Show graph in logs.\n commit $ git add -p Commit only parts of file. Interactively choose chunks of patch.\n blame To see who wrote the code? For each line of the file what commit edited that line of code will be shown. So now you can use that git commit and pass it to git show \u0026lt;commit\u0026gt; to see all the changes.\n$ git blame path/to/file  cherry-pick To move a commit from one branch to another branch. Situation where: I committed to master when I meant to commit to my feature branch. I need to move my commit!\nGet the commit hash\n$ git show Change to the branch you wanted to add that commit\n$ git checkout \u0026lt;feature-branch\u0026gt; Add it to the branch you are on\n$ git cherry-pick \u0026lt;commit hash\u0026gt; cherry-pick creates an entirely new commit based off the original, and it does not delete the original commit. So you will have to delete it manually. See below how to do it.\nYou can also get conflict during cherry-pick\n$ git cherry-pick 435bedfa Resolve the conflict and then\n$ git cherry-pick --continue  reset Remove the last commit.\n$ git reset --hard HEAD^ HEAD : the commit I\u0026rsquo;m currently sitting on\nHEAD^ : this commit\u0026rsquo;s parent\nHEAD^^: this commit\u0026rsquo;s grandparent and so on\nRemove the changes that were accidentally added and not comitted.\n$ git reset HEAD If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to have the uncommitted changes.\n$ git reset --hard HEAD  rebase  rebase is a command for changing history. Never change history when other people might be using your branch, unless they know you\u0026rsquo;re doing so. Never change history on master. Best practice: only change history for commits that have not yet been pushed.  $ git checkout master $ git pull --ff upstream master $ git checkout \u0026lt;feature-branch\u0026gt; $ git rebase master -i While pushing need to do force push because there is change of history. Local branch and remote branch have diverged.\n$ git push origin \u0026lt;feature-branch\u0026gt; -f In case of conflicts, find the conflicting file.\n$ git status reolve those conflicts and then continue the rebase\n$ git status $ git rebase --continue  Use the same commit message Use the commit message that was generated automatically\ngit merge --no-edit OR\ngit commit --amend --no-edit  Squashing commits  Amending the commit  $ git add missing-file $ git commit --amend  Squashing  Look at last 5 commits. Below command will open the text editor.\n$ git rebase --interactive HEAD~5 Once in editor, you can select which ones to squash into previous one and ones to pick as it is. Now type new commit message to squashed commits.\n Splitting commits $ git rebase --i HEAD~3 Now this will open the commit history in editor. The commit you want to split, change it from pick to edit. Save that file. Git will pause in the rebase process and give us time to create new commits. The too-big commit is already present, so let\u0026rsquo;s pop it off, but keep the changes:\n$ git reset HEAD^ Not using --hard because we want to have the changes we wanted. Make changes as needed. Now add individual file and commit. And continue rebase.\n$ git rebase --continue  Find no. of commits on your branch If you have worked on a branch and have added bunch of commits to it, so how do you find out how many commits you have added?\n$ git rev-list f28adfba5ec4f1b02153e9dcc0298ace118ca9d9..HEAD 5f3693549451429beb7ca17699d83a45f7d8ab49 a50cc4d9fe4d6feb3bb150f9762bad643adbacf0 This is two commits, you can pipe it to wc to find out the number.\n bisect The feature\u0026rsquo;s broken? But it was working fine 2 months ago\u0026hellip; what changes? Bisect will help you find the commit that introduced the problem.\n Need commit where it was working, commit where it\u0026rsquo;s broken and a test to verify that.  $ git bisect start $ git checkout broken-commit $ git bisect bad $ git checkout working-commit $ git bisect good  Auto-correct mis-types in commands $ git config --global help.autocorrect 10  Edit git output colors Set various colors to the git logs and all the git output\n$ git config --global color.ui auto  Git merge from someone else\u0026rsquo;s fork Add their github fork repo as a remote to a clone of your own repo:\n$ git remote add other-guys-repo \u0026lt;url to other guys repo\u0026gt; Get their changes:\n$ git fetch other-guys-repo Checkout the branch where you want to merge:\n$ git checkout my_new_branch Merge their changes in (assuming they did their work on the master branch):\n$ git merge other-guys-repo/master Resolve conflicts, commit the resolutions and voila. Quick Ref: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5606062\n stash Save the changes and clean the tree.\ngit stash Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean working directory. The command saves your local modifications away and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.\ngit stash --include-untracked git config --global alias.staash \u0026#39;stash --include-untracked\u0026#39; If the --include-untracked option is used, all untracked files are also stashed and then cleaned up with git clean, leaving the working directory in a very clean state.\ngit stash --all git config --global alias.staaash \u0026#39;stash --all\u0026#39; If the --all option is used instead then the ignored files are stashed and cleaned in addition to the untracked files.\n How to pull remote branch from somebody else\u0026rsquo;s PR git remote add coworker git://path/to/coworkers/repo.git git fetch coworker git checkout --track coworker/foo This will setup a local branch foo, tracking the remote branch coworker/foo. So when your coworker has made some changes, you can easily pull them:\ngit checkout foo git pull Quick Ref: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5884825\nOR\nAdd following code snippet to ~/.bashrc, this will way you have alias to pull any PR.\nfunction pr() { id=$1 if [ -z $id ]; then echo \u0026#34;Need Pull request number as argument\u0026#34; return 1 fi git fetch upstream pull/${id}/head:pr_${id} git checkout pr_${id} } Usage\npr \u0026lt;pr_number\u0026gt;  Tips on writing git commits  How to Write a Git Commit Message Conventional Commits 1.0.0-beta.1   Tools   Commitizen - Helps in writing commits\n  Bash Git Prompt\nInstall using following:\ncd \u0026amp;\u0026amp; git clone https://github.com/magicmonty/bash-git-prompt.git .bash-git-prompt echo \u0026#39; #====================================== # bash git prompt source ~/.bash-git-prompt/gitprompt.sh GIT_PROMPT_ONLY_IN_REPO=1 #====================================== \u0026#39; | tee -a ~/.bashrc    Github These are tips about using github.com\n  allow edits from maintainers\nThis will help so that maintainers can push on your branch.

You can search here, just start typing here, after the project navigator window is opened.\n Shift + Insert in Project window  Here you can add new file to the project. The filename could be the entire path, so the intermediate directories will be created for you.\n Ctrl + N  Find a struct or class definition by name.\n Ctrl + Shift + N  Find a file by name. If you type file name and number seprated by number it will take you to the line in that file. e.g. main.go:6 This will take you to line 6 in main.go.\n Ctrl + Shift + Alt + N  Find any symbol in the project. Here symbol means mainly type.\n Shift + Shift  Search anything anywhere.\n Ctrl + F4  Close section that is active.\n Ctrl + Tab  Switcher to switch between open items\n Ctrl + Shift + B  Jump to definition.\n Ctrl + B  Find usage of that element in project. Or find declaration of a variable.\n Ctrl + Shift + P  Find type of a variable.\n Ctrl + cursor up/down  Navigate the code window up and down\n Ctrl + D  Duplicate a line or selection.\n Ctrl + Y  Delete a line or selection.\n Ctrl + /  Comment/Uncomment out with line comment, a line or selected block.\n Ctrl + Shift + /  Comment/Uncomment out with block comment, a line or selected block.\n Alt + Shift + cursor up/down  Move line or selection up/down.\n Alt + -\u0026gt; or Alt + \u0026lt;-  Switch tabs of open files.\n Ctrl + E  Show recently openend files.\n Ctrl + Shift + A \u0026lsquo;Scratch files\u0026rsquo;  If you need files that are not part of project but need to test something.\n Ctrl + Shift + F12  Hide all the windows and make editor full screen and press again to go back to having all the windows.\n View + Enter Distraction Free mode  This will only keep editor rest everything goes away.\n Ctrl + Shift + \u0026lt;- or Ctrl + Shift + -\u0026gt;  When in the project navigation window you can resize it.\n Ctrl + W  Select a word, press again and select a line, then select entire line then entire block, then entire outcasting block and so on.\n Shift + Alt + up/down cursor  When a line or block of code is selected and wanna move up and down.\n Ctrl + Shift + V  To see your clipboard history\n Alt + mouse click in location  To have multiple cursors. To get out of this mode just press escape key.\n Shift + F6  This will select all occurrences of the current word, so you can edit all of them at once. After you are done edition press enter.\n Alt + J  When pressed on a word, it finds the next occurrence of the word and puts a cursor there. So I can edit mutiple occurrences of same word simultaneously.\n Ctrl + Alt + I  Select a block of code and get indentation right.\n Ctrl + Alt + L  Reformat the code.\n Alt + Enter  Goto a string and press this key and then you can do language injection. So you can tell intellij to interpret that string as json or something like that. So this helps in adding markup languages as string as a part of code. Also you can inject regular expression and then check if the string is validated against the regular expressions you put in.\n Alt + /  So when a recommendation is opened up and if you press above key combination, the word is completed but if you keep pressing those keys the recommendation rotates through all the recommendation.\n Ctrl + J  Recommend templates, if there are any pre-defined.\n Ctrl + Shift + Enter  Auto complete the current statement.\n Ctrl + F12  Navigate file structure, you can start typing and search for things. And then by pressing the enter key you can jump to the definition.\n Alt + 7  Similar functionality as above only difference is that it opens in a side bar.\n Ctrl + Shift + A \u0026lsquo;annotate\u0026rsquo;  Start annotation to see who made changes on each line. From here you can copy the revision number and then search it in the \u0026lsquo;version control\u0026rsquo; window.\n Alt + F12  Terminal in IDE\n Alt + 9  Version Control window\nNotes and Tips  In code you can write TODOs and FIXME and then IDE can identify them and you can write code later on in there. There is a plugin called as \u0026lsquo;Presentation Assistant\u0026rsquo; which shows what keys did you type In the project window(side bar), select Auto Scroll from Source so when you are moving from one file to another it shows in the project side bar where that file is right now. When navigating in the project side bar, to start editing certain file press function key F4. Press Enter to just view it.  Other receipes Compare branches  Press Ctrl + Shift + A to open the action window, search for branches, open branches window. Also can be done as. Once branch pop-window is open, select with what branch you wanna compare current checked out branch and select compare. It will open up a window with all changes, in top tabs select diff, then select a file you wanna compare. Above steps are also given here.
