      <description>This post will demonstrate how Kubernetes HostPath volumes can help you get access to the Kubernetes nodes. Atleast you can play with the filesystem of the node on which you pod is scheduled on. You can get access to other containers running on the host, certificates of the kubelet, etc.
I have a 3-master and 3-node cluster and setup using this script, running in a Vagrant environment.
All the nodes are in ready state:</description>

      <description>How do you access the etcd that is being used by the OpenShift started by oc cluster up or using minishift.
If you are using minishift then get docker environment access of the minishift VM by running following commands.
eval $(minishift docker-env) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; eval $(minishift oc-env)  Exec into the container named origin that runs OpenShift and all the needed services.
$ docker exec -it origin bash  First install the etcdctl needed to talk to etcd.</description>
