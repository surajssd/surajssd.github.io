      <description>Yes, today&amp;rsquo;s topic is typing skills. I think not many people stress about it, but it is a very underrated skill, yet useful in our daily lives.
I typed the most organic way anybody starts doing it. Look at the keyboard when you are typing and fix mistakes after looking at the monitor. I moved my hand around on the keyboard and only used index fingers to touch the keys as if other fingers were glued together away from the keyboard.</description>

      <description>If you are reading this, you are definitely a Knowledge Worker. As Knowledge Workers, we rely a lot on the information we know or have access to for our day to day work. Occasionally, we will do the same thing twice, face the situation more than once, want to read that reference or try to understand the insights mentioned in that one particular blog. How do you keep track of such information?</description>

      <description>There are various ways to know about the release of your favourite new software, follow the mailing list, check the Github release page periodically, follow the project&amp;rsquo;s Twitter handle, etc. But do you know there is even more reliable way to track the releases of your favourite software released on Github.
Github Releases and RSS feeds For every repository on Github, if the project is posting their releases, you can follow the RSS feed of that project&amp;rsquo;s release.</description>

      <description>This blog will showcase my productivity tips with kubectl . This does not venture into any plugins per se. But only using bash aliases to achieve it.
Bash Aliases # k8s alias alias k=kubectl alias kg=&amp;#34;kubectl get&amp;#34; alias kgp=&amp;#34;kubectl get pods&amp;#34; alias kgs=&amp;#34;kubectl get services&amp;#34; alias kge=&amp;#34;kubectl get events&amp;#34; alias kgpvc=&amp;#34;kubectl get pvc&amp;#34; alias kgpv=&amp;#34;kubectl get pv&amp;#34; alias kd=&amp;#34;kubectl describe&amp;#34; alias kl=&amp;#34;kubectl logs -f&amp;#34; alias kc=&amp;#34;kubectl create -f&amp;#34; I have above aliases setup in the ~/.</description>

      <title>Framework for managing random scripts and binaries</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/framework-for-scripts-and-binaries/</link>

      <description>I always had a conundrum about how to manage the scripts and binaries downloaded randomly from the internet. One way is to put them in the global PATH directory like /usr/local/bin, but I am sceptical about it.
There are a couple of things I wanted to solve. How do you update these scripts and binaries? How to do it consistently across all my machines? How to make it easier to have my setup available on any new Linux machine(or even container) I setup?</description>
