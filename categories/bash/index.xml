      <title>Exec in container environment</title>

      <description>If you use exec in your container script, then the container or Kubernetes pod might exit after the command that is exec-ed into has exited. But if that&amp;rsquo;s what you wanted, then it&amp;rsquo;s okay. This blog tries to explain how to pass the signals to the applications, how they work differently when invoked uniquely and what to do if the application does handle them.
What are the &amp;ldquo;Signals&amp;rdquo;? Signals are messages one process can send to another process, mostly used in UNIX like operating systems.</description>

      <title>Use Configmap for Scripts</title>

      <description>We generally use some sort of scripts in application container images. They serve various purposes. Some scripts might do an initial setup before the application starts, others may have the whole logic of the container image, etc. Whatever the goal may be the general pattern is to copy the script into the container image, build the image and then the script is available when you consume the image.
Cons of the Traditional Method The round trip time during development and testing of such script is very long.</description>

      <description>This blog will showcase my productivity tips with kubectl . This does not venture into any plugins per se. But only using bash aliases to achieve it.
Bash Aliases # k8s alias alias k=kubectl alias kg=&amp;#34;kubectl get&amp;#34; alias kgp=&amp;#34;kubectl get pods&amp;#34; alias kgs=&amp;#34;kubectl get services&amp;#34; alias kge=&amp;#34;kubectl get events&amp;#34; alias kgpvc=&amp;#34;kubectl get pvc&amp;#34; alias kgpv=&amp;#34;kubectl get pv&amp;#34; alias kd=&amp;#34;kubectl describe&amp;#34; alias kl=&amp;#34;kubectl logs -f&amp;#34; alias kc=&amp;#34;kubectl create -f&amp;#34; I have above aliases setup in the ~/.</description>

      <title>Framework for managing random scripts and binaries</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/framework-for-scripts-and-binaries/</link>

      <description>I always had a conundrum about how to manage the scripts and binaries downloaded randomly from the internet. One way is to put them in the global PATH directory like /usr/local/bin, but I am sceptical about it.
There are a couple of things I wanted to solve. How do you update these scripts and binaries? How to do it consistently across all my machines? How to make it easier to have my setup available on any new Linux machine(or even container) I setup?</description>
