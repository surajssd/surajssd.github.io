      <description>I recently cleared the CKS certification exam. So it is incumbent upon me to help you navigate this stress-bound exam. All the tips that are provided are either from accrued knowledge or from personal experience.
Study Material During the study of CKA almost three years ago, I studied everything from the documentation. Back then, the documentation had less content hence it was comprehensible. But now, to go through the entire documentation was not practical.</description>

      <description>If you are studying for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) exam, you might have come across folks recommending Kelsey Hightower&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes the Hard Way. It is an excellent first step for someone who has no idea about the components that form a Kubernetes cluster. As the name suggests, it is created so that you learn the Kubernetes building blocks the &amp;ldquo;hard way&amp;rdquo;.
But all that can be intimidating to someone who hasn&amp;rsquo;t played with Kubernetes ever.</description>

      <description>I passed CKA exam with 92% marks on 19th October 2018.
A lot of folks are curious about how to prepare and what resources to follow. Here is my list of things to do and list of resources that might help you on successful CKA exam.
The duration of exam is three hours, which is enough time if you do good practice. The exam is pretty straight forward and tests your Kubernetes hands-on knowledge, so whatever you read please try to do it on a real cluster.</description>
