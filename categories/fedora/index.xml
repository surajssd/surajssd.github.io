      <description>I use Fedora Linux as my primary desktop OS. Every time there is a fresh install, I find myself confounded on how to partition the OS. So I thought I might as well make a permanent note of how I do it so that I always have a place to come back to.&#xA;Partitioning Scheme This is how I partition my Fedora during installation:&#xA;Partition Mounted On Size Encrypted Filesystem Boot /boot 512M No ext4 Boot EFI /boot/efi 200M No vfat Swap - 1.</description>

      <description>I am about to attempt the CKA exam and it has a browser based terminal. And I am used to this terminal shortcut Ctrl + W which deletes a word. But the same shortcut in browser can close a tab. Since this exam is combination of both I am afraid I might close my exam tab while deleting a word in terminal. Now the only solution to this is disabling the shortcut in chrome.</description>

      <description>If you have some box that was downloaded on your machine from Atlas but now you wanna share it on other machines and you don&amp;rsquo;t have internet to download it, how do you share it?&#xA;You will need to export the box from machine that has it downloaded already. So on machine with boxes:&#xA;$ vagrant box list centos/7 (libvirt, 1610.01) centos/7 (libvirt, 1704.01) fedora/25-cloud-base (libvirt, 20161122) fedora/26-cloud-base (libvirt, 20170705) I wanted to share fedora/26-cloud-base box to another machine.</description>
