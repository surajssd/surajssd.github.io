      <description>Introduction I recently finished reading the book: &amp;ldquo;How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom&amp;rdquo; by Matt Ridley. The book was published less than a year ago in May 2020, and it is a short read of fewer than four hundred pages. I am not sure how to categorise this book, it probably falls into business, science and/or technological history.
While listening to Naval Ravikant&amp;rsquo;s podcast, I found this book when Matt Ridley, the author, was a guest in one episode.</description>

      <description>Introduction The book &amp;ldquo;Algorithms to Live by — The Computer Science of Human Decisions&amp;rdquo; is written by &amp;ldquo;Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths&amp;rdquo;. It fits into the genre non-fiction, psychology and computer science. The book is written lucidly. If you have a background in computer science, then this book is easy to follow. The book creates analogies of computer science algorithms with real-life situations. I felt that some metaphors sound good in reading than their application, so if you plan on applying the things explained in the book directly to your life, they might not work.</description>

      <description>Introduction Recently I completed the book called Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-free Productivity by David Allen. I read the book on my kindle e-reader device, and as the name suggests, it is a self-help category book and about three hundred pages long.
The book is an extraordinary walkthrough of how to set up a system that will help you navigate your daily tasks without missing any of them. This system then enables you to patch up the crevices of your memory from which day-to-day tasks fall through.</description>

      <title>Opinion: Contemporary world vis-à-vis 1984 by George Orwell</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/opinion-contemporary-world-1984-by-george-orwell/</link>

      <description>The book 1984 was written by Geroge Orwell in 1949 as an attempt to demonstrate how democraries can also fall into the trap of totalitarianism. The story in the book showcases a dystopian world in the year 1984, where there are only three countries in the world, and all of them are in a constant power struggle. All three countries have a totalitarian, oligarchic government of their own. But the story in the book is from a country called Oceania, which is ruled by a party called Ingsoc or English Socialism.</description>

      <title>Book Review of Einstein: His Life and Universe</title>

      <description>I recently finished this book Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson. And here are my thoughts on the book.
It&amp;rsquo;s a book that brings the image of Einstein to life.
Although the book is a biography, it makes a reasonable effort in explaining the physics behind his theories of relativity, photoelectric effect and quantum physics. Physics in the book can be intimidating to someone coming from the non-Scientific background.</description>
