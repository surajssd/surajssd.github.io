Synopsis of the Book The Psychology of Money, written by Morgan Housel, published in 2020, could be categorised under Psychology, Finance, and Nonfiction. The author wrote an article three years ago which got a lot of traffic hence decided to write a book out of it. Last year I saw that the book was recommended by many folks in my network and on Twitter. All of the recommenders were highly impressed by the book and spoke intensely of it.</description>

      <title>Religious Rituals Don&#39;t Scale With Population</title>

      <description>There are numerous Hindu festivals celebrated throughout the year. The rituals associated with each festival differ to the extent these festivals are celebrated. I am here to recount the environmental impact of the customs Hindus are involved in.
Although a ritual associated with each festival and its effect on the environment is insignificant on a small scale. But with Hindus in India being close to a billion (966 million as per the 2011 census, with the population growth rate that might be almost a billion), these rituals don&amp;rsquo;t scale very well.</description>

      <title>How we manage Kubernetes Bangalore Meetup?</title>

      <description>I took the reins of the Kubernetes Bangalore Meetup back in 2017. I have been organising the meetup since then. Earlier with Suraj Narwade, Aditya Konarde and now with Prakash Mishra. Over time the meetup has grown a lot, now it boasts about 5000 members. Organising meetup earlier was a straightforward affair, especially with Narwade and Konarde being my colleagues and friends. We could chat about the upcoming meetup at any time we would like, and it was all spontaneous.</description>

      <title>On Compounder Skills</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/2021/03/compounder-skills/</link>

      <description>There are specific skills which you should acquire early on in your life. These skills are the foundational skills. Everything you do after developing these skills becomes better, faster and easier. I call these skills Compounder Skills. Derived from the term &amp;ldquo;Compound Interest&amp;rdquo;. The idea is that once you are laced with a particular compounder skill, you can apply it in various fields of your life. An example of a compounder skill that most humans get exposed to is &amp;ldquo;school education&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>Importance of Typing Skills</title>

      <description>Yes, today&amp;rsquo;s topic is typing skills. I think not many people stress about it, but it is a very underrated skill, yet useful in our daily lives.
I typed the most organic way anybody starts doing it. Look at the keyboard when you are typing and fix mistakes after looking at the monitor. I moved my hand around on the keyboard and only used index fingers to touch the keys as if other fingers were glued together away from the keyboard.</description>

      <title>Book: How Innovation Works</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/2021/02/book-hiw-learnings/</link>

      <description>Introduction I recently finished reading the book: &amp;ldquo;How Innovation Works: And Why It Flourishes in Freedom&amp;rdquo; by Matt Ridley. The book was published less than a year ago in May 2020, and it is a short read of fewer than four hundred pages. I am not sure how to categorise this book, it probably falls into business, science and/or technological history.
While listening to Naval Ravikant&amp;rsquo;s podcast, I found this book when Matt Ridley, the author, was a guest in one episode.</description>

      <title>Book Review: Algorithms to Live by — The Computer Science of Human Decisions</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/book-review-algorithms-to-live-by-the-computer-science-of-human-decisions/</link>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/book-review-algorithms-to-live-by-the-computer-science-of-human-decisions/</guid>
      <description>Introduction The book &amp;ldquo;Algorithms to Live by — The Computer Science of Human Decisions&amp;rdquo; is written by &amp;ldquo;Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths&amp;rdquo;. It fits into the genre non-fiction, psychology and computer science. The book is written lucidly. If you have a background in computer science, then this book is easy to follow. The book creates analogies of computer science algorithms with real-life situations. I felt that some metaphors sound good in reading than their application, so if you plan on applying the things explained in the book directly to your life, they might not work.</description>

      <description>Introduction Recently I completed the book called Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-free Productivity by David Allen. I read the book on my kindle e-reader device, and as the name suggests, it is a self-help category book and about three hundred pages long.
The book is an extraordinary walkthrough of how to set up a system that will help you navigate your daily tasks without missing any of them. This system then enables you to patch up the crevices of your memory from which day-to-day tasks fall through.</description>

      <title>Opinion: Contemporary world vis-à-vis 1984 by George Orwell</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/opinion-contemporary-world-1984-by-george-orwell/</link>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/opinion-contemporary-world-1984-by-george-orwell/</guid>
      <description>The book 1984 was written by Geroge Orwell in 1949 as an attempt to demonstrate how democraries can also fall into the trap of totalitarianism. The story in the book showcases a dystopian world in the year 1984, where there are only three countries in the world, and all of them are in a constant power struggle. All three countries have a totalitarian, oligarchic government of their own. But the story in the book is from a country called Oceania, which is ruled by a party called Ingsoc or English Socialism.</description>

      <title>Book Review of Einstein: His Life and Universe</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/book-review-einstein/</link>

      <description>I recently finished this book Einstein: His Life and Universe by Walter Isaacson. And here are my thoughts on the book.
It&amp;rsquo;s a book that brings the image of Einstein to life.
Although the book is a biography, it makes a reasonable effort in explaining the physics behind his theories of relativity, photoelectric effect and quantum physics. Physics in the book can be intimidating to someone coming from the non-Scientific background.</description>
