      <description>There are various ways to know about the release of your favourite new software, follow the mailing list, check the Github release page periodically, follow the project&amp;rsquo;s Twitter handle, etc. But do you know there is even more reliable way to track the releases of your favourite software released on Github.
Github Releases and RSS feeds For every repository on Github, if the project is posting their releases, you can follow the RSS feed of that project&amp;rsquo;s release.</description>

      <description>Test Fixtures  &amp;ldquo;go test&amp;rdquo; sets pwd as package directory  Test Helpers  should never return an error they should access to the *testing.T object call t.Helper() in the beginning (works only for go1.9+) for things reqiuiring clean up return closures  Configurability  Unconfigurable behavior is often a point of difficulty for tests. e.g. ports, timeouts, paths. Over-parameterize structs to allow tests to fine-tune their behavior It&amp;rsquo;s ok to make these configs unexported so only tests can set them.</description>
