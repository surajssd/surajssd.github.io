      <title>Mental models for understanding Kubernetes Pod Security Policy</title>

      <description>PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) is hard to get right in the first attempt. There has never been a situation when I haven&amp;rsquo;t banged my head to get it working on the cluster. It is a frustrating experience, but it is one of the essential security features of Kubernetes. Some applications have started shipping the PSP configs with their helm charts, but if a helm chart does not ship a PSP config, it must be handcrafted by the cluster-admin to make the application work reliably in the cluster.</description>

      <title>How to gracefully kill Kubernetes Jobs with a sidecar?</title>

      <description>Have you ever had a sidecar in your Kubernetes Job? If no, then trust me that you are lucky. If yes, then you will have the frustration of your life. The thing is Kubernetes Jobs are meant to exit on completion. But if you have a long-running sidecar, then that might twist things for Kubernetes and in turn of you.
Why would you even want a sidecar for Job? Well, one of the most prevalent use case is when using service mesh proxy.</description>

      <title>Use Configmap for Scripts</title>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/use-configmap-for-scripts/</guid>
      <description>We generally use some sort of scripts in application container images. They serve various purposes. Some scripts might do an initial setup before the application starts, others may have the whole logic of the container image, etc. Whatever the goal may be the general pattern is to copy the script into the container image, build the image and then the script is available when you consume the image.
Cons of the Traditional Method The round trip time during development and testing of such script is very long.</description>

      <description>This blog will showcase my productivity tips with kubectl . This does not venture into any plugins per se. But only using bash aliases to achieve it.
Bash Aliases # k8s alias alias k=kubectl alias kg=&amp;#34;kubectl get&amp;#34; alias kgp=&amp;#34;kubectl get pods&amp;#34; alias kgs=&amp;#34;kubectl get services&amp;#34; alias kge=&amp;#34;kubectl get events&amp;#34; alias kgpvc=&amp;#34;kubectl get pvc&amp;#34; alias kgpv=&amp;#34;kubectl get pv&amp;#34; alias kd=&amp;#34;kubectl describe&amp;#34; alias kl=&amp;#34;kubectl logs -f&amp;#34; alias kc=&amp;#34;kubectl create -f&amp;#34; I have above aliases setup in the ~/.</description>

      <title>How to backup and restore Prometheus?</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/how-to-backup-and-restore-prometheus/</link>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/how-to-backup-and-restore-prometheus/</guid>
      <description>This blog will show you how to take a backup from a running Prometheus and restore it in some other Prometheus instance. You might ask why would you even want to do something like that? Well, sometimes you want the Prometheus metrics because they were collected for some particular purpose and you want to do some analysis later.
Prerequisites/Assumptions This blog assumes that you have a Prometheus running that is deployed using prometheus-operator in monitoring namespace.</description>

      <title>Watch Container Traffic Without Exec</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/snoop-on-pod-traffic/</link>

      <description>Introduction For the reasons of security, many container deployments nowadays run their workloads in a scratch based image. This form of implementation helps reduce the attack surface since there is no shell to gain access to, especially if someone were to break out of the application.
But for the developers or operators of such applications, it is hard to debug. Since they lack essential tools or even bash for that matter, but the application&amp;rsquo;s debugging ability should not dictate its production deployment and compromise its security posture.</description>

      <title>Enabling Seccomp on your Prometheus Operator and related Pods</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/seccomp-in-kube-state-metrics/</link>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/seccomp-in-kube-state-metrics/</guid>
      <description>Seccomp helps us limit the system calls the process inside container can make. And PodSecurityPolicy is the way to enable it on pods in Kubernetes.
Prometheus Operator Prometheus Operator makes it really easy to monitor your Kubernetes cluster. To deploy this behemoth, helm chart is the easiest way to do it.
Almost all the pods that run as a part of Prometheus Operator viz. Prometheus Operator, Prometheus, Alertmanager, Grafana, Kube State Metrics don’t need to run with elevated privileges except Node Exporter.</description>

      <title>Make static configs available for apiserver in minikube</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/apiserver-in-minikube-static-configs/</link>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/apiserver-in-minikube-static-configs/</guid>
      <description>If you want to provide extra flags to the kube-apiserver that runs inside minikube how do you do it? You can use the minikube&amp;rsquo;s --extra-config flag with apiserver.&amp;lt;apiserver flag&amp;gt;=&amp;lt;value&amp;gt;, for e.g. if you want to enable RBAC authorization mode you do it as follows:
--extra-config=apiserver.authorization-mode=RBAC So this is a no brainer when doing it for flags whose value can be given right away, like the one above. But what if you want to provide value which is a file path.</description>

      <description>A volume mount CVE was discovered in Kubernetes 1.9 and older which allowed access to node file system using emptyDir volume mount using subpath. The official description goes as follows:
 In Kubernetes versions 1.3.x, 1.4.x, 1.5.x, 1.6.x and prior to versions 1.7.14, 1.8.9 and 1.9.4 containers using subpath volume mounts with any volume type (including non-privileged pods, subject to file permissions) can access files/directories outside of the volume, including the host&amp;rsquo;s filesystem.</description>

      <title>Add new Node to k8s cluster with Bootstrap token</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/add-new-k8s-node-bootstrap-token/</link>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/add-new-k8s-node-bootstrap-token/</guid>
      <description>Few days back I wrote a blog about adding new node to the cluster using the static token file. The problem with that approach is that you need to restart kube-apiserver providing it the path to the token file. Here we will see how to use the bootstrap token, which is very dynamic in nature and can be controlled by using Kubernetes resources like secrets.
So if you are following Kubernetes the Hard Way to set up the cluster here are the changes you should do to adapt it to run with bootstrap token.</description>

      <title>PodSecurityPolicy on existing Kubernetes clusters</title>
      <link>https://suraj.io/post/psp-on-existing-cluster/</link>

      <guid>https://suraj.io/post/psp-on-existing-cluster/</guid>
      <description>I enabled PodSecurityPolicy on a minikube cluster by appending PodSecurityPolicy to the apiserver flag in minikube like this:
--extra-config=apiserver.enable-admission-plugins=Initializers,NamespaceLifecycle,\  LimitRanger,ServiceAccount,DefaultStorageClass,DefaultTolerationSeconds,\  NodeRestriction,MutatingAdmissionWebhook,ValidatingAdmissionWebhook,\  ResourceQuota,PodSecurityPolicy Ideally when you have PSP enabled and if you don&amp;rsquo;t define any PSP and authorize it with right RBAC no pod will start in the cluster. But what I saw was that there were some pods still running in kube-system namespace.
$ kubectl -n kube-system get pods NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE coredns-576cbf47c7-g2t8v 1/1 Running 4 5d11h etcd-minikube 1/1 Running 2 5d11h heapster-bn5xp 1/1 Running 2 5d11h influxdb-grafana-qzpv4 2/2 Running 4 5d11h kube-addon-manager-minikube 1/1 Running 2 5d11h kube-controller-manager-minikube 1/1 Running 1 4d20h kube-scheduler-minikube 1/1 Running 2 5d11h kubernetes-dashboard-5bb6f7c8c6-9d564 1/1 Running 8 5d11h storage-provisioner 1/1 Running 7 5d11h Which got me thinking what is wrong with the way PSPs work.</description>

      <description>I passed CKA exam with 92% marks on 19th October 2018.
A lot of folks are curious about how to prepare and what resources to follow. Here is my list of things to do and list of resources that might help you on successful CKA exam.
The duration of exam is three hours, which is enough time if you do good practice. The exam is pretty straight forward and tests your Kubernetes hands-on knowledge, so whatever you read please try to do it on a real cluster.</description>

      <description>The setup here is created by following Kubernetes the Hard Way by Kelsey Hightower. So if you are following along in this then do all the setup till the step Bootstrapping the Kubernetes Worker Nodes. In this just don&amp;rsquo;t start the kubelet, start other services like containerd and kube-proxy.

      <description>This post will demonstrate how Kubernetes HostPath volumes can help you get access to the Kubernetes nodes. Atleast you can play with the filesystem of the node on which you pod is scheduled on. You can get access to other containers running on the host, certificates of the kubelet, etc.
I have a 3-master and 3-node cluster and setup using this script, running in a Vagrant environment.
All the nodes are in ready state:</description>

      <description>There is no easy way to change namespace in Kubernetes using kubectl command line utility. But here are some commands that you can alias in your bashrc file so that it&amp;rsquo;s just a single command that you can use to change the namespace in the Kubernetes cluster.
Change namespace Let&amp;rsquo;s see step by step what goes in to change the namespace. So the first step is to find the context.</description>

      <description>I am doing Kubernetes native development using minikube. And for doing that I had to download a Container image that is available in internally hosted private container registry.
On the configuration side of doing that you will need to create Kubernetes Secret of type docker-registry. And now refer that secret you just created in your Pod manifest under pod.spec.imagePullSecrets. For more info follow the tutorial in Kubernetes docs on Pull an Image from a Private Registry.</description>

      <description>I wanted to try out Standalone Kubelet Tutorial of Kelsey Hightower by myself but I could not follow it as it is, because it was firstly on GCE and secondly it uses CoreOS, but since I am very familiar to Fedora I thought of following that tutorial on it. To get a quick setup of a fresh Fedora machine use Vagrant. I have used Vagrantfile available here.
