      <description>If you use exec in your container script, then the container or Kubernetes pod might exit after the command that is exec-ed into has exited. But if that&amp;rsquo;s what you wanted, then it&amp;rsquo;s okay. This blog tries to explain how to pass the signals to the applications, how they work differently when invoked uniquely and what to do if the application does handle them.
What are the &amp;ldquo;Signals&amp;rdquo;? Signals are messages one process can send to another process, mostly used in UNIX like operating systems.</description>

      <title>Framework for managing random scripts and binaries</title>

      <description>I always had a conundrum about how to manage the scripts and binaries downloaded randomly from the internet. One way is to put them in the global PATH directory like /usr/local/bin, but I am sceptical about it.
There are a couple of things I wanted to solve. How do you update these scripts and binaries? How to do it consistently across all my machines? How to make it easier to have my setup available on any new Linux machine(or even container) I setup?</description>
