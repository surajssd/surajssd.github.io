      <description>PodSecurityPolicy (PSP) is hard to get right in the first attempt. There has never been a situation when I haven&amp;rsquo;t banged my head to get it working on the cluster. It is a frustrating experience, but it is one of the essential security features of Kubernetes. Some applications have started shipping the PSP configs with their helm charts, but if a helm chart does not ship a PSP config, it must be handcrafted by the cluster-admin to make the application work reliably in the cluster.</description>
