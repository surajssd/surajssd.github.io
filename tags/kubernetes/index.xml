      <title>Prometheus with existing application on OpenShift</title>

      <description>This post is very specific to OpenShift and how you can have an application exposing prometheus metrics to be scraped by a prometheus running in the same cluster.
Requirements Setting up cluster I have done it using the oc cluster up, read about how to do this here. You could also setup a local OpenShift cluster by running minishift, read about setting up minishift here.
Downloading Kedge The configurations defined for setting up this cluster is written in a format that is understood by a tool called Kedge.</description>

      <title>Using private container registries from minikube</title>
      <link>http://suraj.io/post/private-registry-from-minikube/</link>

      <description>I am doing Kubernetes native development using minikube. And for doing that I had to download a Container image that is available in internally hosted private container registry.
On the configuration side of doing that you will need to create Kubernetes Secret of type docker-registry. And now refer that secret you just created in your Pod manifest under pod.spec.imagePullSecrets. For more info follow the tutorial in Kubernetes docs on Pull an Image from a Private Registry.</description>

      <title>Static Pods using Kubelet on Fedora</title>

      <description>I wanted to try out Standalone Kubelet Tutorial of Kelsey Hightower by myself but I could not follow it as it is, because it was firstly on GCE and secondly it uses CoreOS, but since I am very familiar to Fedora I thought of following that tutorial on it. To get a quick setup of a fresh Fedora machine use Vagrant. I have used Vagrantfile available here.
This blog is only replacement of section Install the Standalone Kubelet in tutorial.</description>

      <description>This edition of meetup was held at Nexus Ventures by folks at OpenEBS on July 8th 2017, which started on a lovely Saturday morning.
Kiran Mova set the floor rolling with his talk on Hyperconverged version of OpenEBS with Kubernetes. Where he talked about containerized storage vs traditional storage, instead of building clustering into OpenEBS how they are leveraging Kubernetes&amp;rsquo;s capabilities to do clustering.
He also explained difference between various storage providers viz.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;One does not simply deploy containers to production&amp;rdquo;
With the rising craze around the container community in Bangalore and relative lack in awareness around different container technologies like Kubernetes and OpenShift, an effort was made in imparting knowledge in this direction.
So, this time around newbies were targeted for the Kubernetes Meetup.
With the above objective, it was decided to have a Kubernetes 101 workshop at Red Hat Bangalore office on May 21, 2017 to familiarize people with concepts of Kubernetes and OpenShift and their usage and relevance as container orchestration tools for managing application deployments.</description>

      <description>I want to show how you can enable Kubernetes in your day to day development workflow. So that you get the feel of production deployment locally from day 1.
I have a flask application which I am working on. The basic directory structure looks like this:
$ ll total 24 -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 427 Apr 23 16:23 app.py -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 201 Apr 23 16:55 docker-compose.yml -rw-rw-r--. 1 foo foo 363 Apr 23 16:21 Dockerfile -rwxrwxr-x.</description>

      <description>I do lot of Kubernetes related work either on minikube or local OpenShift cluster setup in a VM. Often I need to create a PersistentVolumeClaim a.k.a. pvc. But to use pvc you have to have a PersistentVolume or pv defined.
Enter into the machine running k8s If using minikube you can do
minikube ssh  Create a local directory for storage mkdir /tmp/pv0001 chmod 777 /tmp/pv0001  If you are on a machine that has SELinux enabled do the following</description>

Suraj Deshmukh set the stage with his opening talk, Kubernetes on CRI-O, wherein he explained different jargons like OCI, CRI, etc.</description>
